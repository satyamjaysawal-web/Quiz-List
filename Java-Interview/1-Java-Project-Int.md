  - Discuss how you handled performance bottlenecks, horizontal scaling, load balancing, etc.

- **What strategies did you use to improve performance in the backend?**
  - Talk about caching (e.g., Redis), query optimization, or asynchronous processing.

- **How did you monitor the performance of your backend services?**
  - Mention tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or New Relic for monitoring and logging.

---

### **6. Version Control and CI/CD**
You might also be asked about how you worked in a team and managed code deployment:

- **What version control system did you use in the project, and what was your branching strategy?**
  - Explain if you used Git, and describe any branching models (e.g., GitFlow).

- **How did you integrate Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)?**
  - Mention tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or CircleCI for automated testing and deployment.

### **7. Cloud and DevOps**
If the project involved **cloud technologies** (e.g., AWS, Azure), you might face questions related to:

- **How did you deploy the application to a cloud platform?**
  - Mention which cloud services you used (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure App Service) and the deployment process.

- **Did you containerize your application? If yes, how?**
  - Talk about using Docker and container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes).

- **What role did you play in managing the application’s infrastructure?**
  - Mention if you worked with Infrastructure as Code (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation) or cloud networking.

### **8. General Problem-Solving Questions**
Lastly, the interviewer may ask about your approach to solving problems:

- **Can you walk me through a challenging bug or issue you encountered in the project? How did you solve it?**
  - Be prepared with a real example where you faced technical challenges and how you overcame them.

- **How did you handle situations where a feature impacted system performance?**
  - Discuss troubleshooting techniques like profiling, optimizing code, or improving database queries.

### **Tips for Preparing:**
1. **Revisit the Project:** Review key aspects of your Liberty Mutual project—architecture, technologies used, challenges, and your personal contributions.
2. **Brush Up on Core Java:** Make sure your fundamentals in **Java** and **Spring** are solid, especially around multithreading, collections, design patterns, and exception handling.
3. **Prepare for Problem-Solving:** Practice solving coding problems in **Java** (e.g., algorithms, data structures) and be ready to walk through your approach.
4. **Know the Domain:** Since you worked on an **insurance-related** project, prepare for questions on how backend systems interact with **insurance products** and **business rules**.
