  - Mention any external APIs you worked with, such as payment gateways, messaging services, etc.

- **How did you handle error handling and exception management in your code?**
  - Discuss patterns like try-catch blocks, custom exceptions, and logging.

- **What types of testing did you perform for your Java backend?**
  - Did you use unit testing, integration testing, or any frameworks like JUnit, Mockito, etc.?

---

### **2. Java Technical Questions**
The interviewer will also ask questions to assess your **Java expertise** and your understanding of **backend development** concepts:

- **Explain the key features of Java 8+ that you used in the project.**
  - Topics like Lambda expressions, Streams API, Optional class, and functional interfaces might come up.

- **How do you manage memory and prevent memory leaks in Java?**
  - Discuss garbage collection, memory management, and avoiding memory leaks.

- **What are the different types of design patterns you used in your backend development?**
  - Mention common patterns like Singleton, Factory, or Observer, and how you applied them.

- **Can you explain the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions in Java?**
  - Be prepared to discuss how and when to use each type of exception.

- **What is the purpose of the `synchronized` keyword in Java?**
  - This is related to multi-threading and concurrency control.

- **Explain the concept of dependency injection and how it was applied in your project.**
  - You may need to describe how Spring Framework or any other DI mechanism was used.

---

### **3. Spring Framework and Microservices**
If you used **Spring Boot** or **Spring Framework** (which is common in Java-based backend development), you may be asked about:

- **How did you use Spring Boot for building RESTful web services?**
  - Explain how you created and managed REST endpoints.

- **How did you manage configurations across different environments (dev, test, prod) using Spring?**
  - You may mention properties files, YAML configurations, or Spring Cloud Config.

- **Explain how dependency injection works in Spring.**
  - Discuss annotations like `@Autowired`, `@Component`, `@Service`, etc.

- **What is the role of `@Transactional` in Spring?**
  - Explain how transactions are managed and committed or rolled back in a Spring application.

- **How did you handle security in the application?**
  - Mention if you used **Spring Security** for authentication/authorization, JWT tokens, or OAuth.

- **Explain how you worked with microservices.**
  - If your project used a microservices architecture, be prepared to discuss service communication (e.g., REST, gRPC), service discovery, and load balancing.

---

### **4. Database and ORM (Hibernate/JPA)**
If your backend involved database interactions, the interviewer may ask questions on **database handling** and **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)**:

- **Which database did you use, and how did you interact with it from your Java code?**
  - Mention the database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and how you used Hibernate or JPA for persistence.

- **How did you optimize database queries?**
  - Discuss using indexing, query optimization, or caching.

- **Explain the difference between `@OneToOne`, `@OneToMany`, and `@ManyToMany` in JPA.**
  - Be ready to explain relational mappings.

- **What is the N+1 query problem, and how did you avoid it?**
  - Explain how eager and lazy loading work in Hibernate and how you managed them.

- **How did you handle transactions and concurrency control in the database?**
  - Be prepared to talk about isolation levels, locking mechanisms, and transaction management in Java.

---

### **5. Performance and Scalability**
For large-scale systems, questions about performance and scaling are common:

- **How did you ensure your Java application was scalable?**
  - Discuss how you handled performance bottlenecks, horizontal scaling, load balancing, etc.

- **What strategies did you use to improve performance in the backend?**

### **Tips for Preparing:**
1. **Revisit the Project:** Review key aspects of your Liberty Mutual project—architecture, technologies used, challenges, and your personal contributions.
2. **Brush Up on Core Java:** Make sure your fundamentals in **Java** and **Spring** are solid, especially around multithreading, collections, design patterns, and exception handling.
3. **Prepare for Problem-Solving:** Practice solving coding problems in **Java** (e.g., algorithms, data structures) and be ready to walk through your approach.
4. **Know the Domain:** Since you worked on an **insurance-related** project, prepare for questions on how backend systems interact with **insurance products** and **business rules**.
