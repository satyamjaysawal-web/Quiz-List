Certainly! Here’s a detailed breakdown of the different types of APIs that could be utilized in a project at Liberty Mutual, specifically focusing on account finance operations. Each type is accompanied by example APIs, use cases, and sample request/response structures.

### 1. **RESTful APIs**

RESTful APIs are widely used for client-server communication over HTTP. They are stateless and use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations.

#### Example APIs

**1.1. Account Information API**

- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/accounts/{accountId}`
- **Description**: Retrieves account details for a specific user.
  
**Sample Request**:
```http
GET /api/v1/accounts/12345 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.libertymutual.com
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Sample Response**:
```json
{
  "accountId": "12345",
  "ownerName": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "balance": 150.75,
  "policies": [
    {
      "policyId": "abc123",
      "policyType": "Auto",
      "premium": 1200.00,
      "nextPaymentDue": "2024-11-01"
    },
    {
      "policyId": "def456",
      "policyType": "Home",
      "premium": 800.00,
      "nextPaymentDue": "2024-12-01"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

**1.2. Payment Processing API**

- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/payments`
- **Description**: Processes a payment for a specified policy.

**Sample Request**:
```http
POST /api/v1/payments HTTP/1.1
Host: api.libertymutual.com
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "accountId": "12345",
  "policyId": "abc123",
  "amount": 150.00,
  "paymentMethod": "credit_card",
  "transactionId": "txn789"
}
```

**Sample Response**:
```json
{
  "paymentStatus": "Success",
  "transactionId": "txn789",
  "amount": 150.00,
  "date": "2024-10-14T10:30:00Z",
  "message": "Payment processed successfully."
}
```

**1.3. Claims Submission API**

- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/claims`
- **Description**: Submits a new insurance claim.

**Sample Request**:
```http
POST /api/v1/claims HTTP/1.1
Host: api.libertymutual.com
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "accountId": "12345",
  "policyId": "abc123",
  "claimType": "accident",
  "description": "Rear-ended at a stoplight.",
  "claimAmount": 5000.00,
  "dateOfIncident": "2024-10-10",
  "attachments": [
    "url_to_photo1.jpg",
    "url_to_photo2.jpg"
  ]
}
```

**Sample Response**:
```json
{
  "claimId": "claim456",
  "claimStatus": "Submitted",
  "message": "Your claim has been submitted successfully. Claim ID: claim456."
}
```

---

### 2. **GraphQL APIs**

GraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need, making it efficient and flexible. It's especially useful when the data structure is complex and varies between different queries.

#### Example API

**2.1. User Account Query**

- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/graphql`
- **Description**: Fetches detailed account information and policies in one request.

**Sample Request**:
```http
POST /api/graphql HTTP/1.1
Host: api.libertymutual.com
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "query": "{
    account(id: \"12345\") {
      ownerName
      email
      balance
      policies {
        policyId
        policyType
        premium
        nextPaymentDue
      }
    }
  }"
}
```

**Sample Response**:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "account": {
      "ownerName": "John Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com",
      "balance": 150.75,
      "policies": [
        {
          "policyId": "abc123",
          "policyType": "Auto",
          "premium": 1200.00,
          "nextPaymentDue": "2024-11-01"
        },
        {
          "policyId": "def456",
          "policyType": "Home",
          "premium": 800.00,
          "nextPaymentDue": "2024-12-01"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. **Webhooks**

Webhooks are user-defined HTTP callbacks that are triggered by specific events. They allow real-time notifications and updates.

#### Example Webhook

**3.1. Claim Status Update Webhook**

- **Webhook URL**: `https://www.example.com/webhooks/claim-status`
- **Description**: Notifies users of changes in claim status.

**Sample Payload** (Sent by Liberty Mutual):
```json
{
  "claimId": "claim456",
  "status": "Approved",
  "approvalDate": "2024-10-12",
  "amountApproved": 4500.00,
  "message": "Your claim has been approved. You will receive the payment shortly."
}
```

---

### 4. **SOAP APIs**

While REST is more commonly used, some legacy systems might still use SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) for communication. SOAP APIs use XML for message formatting.

#### Example API

**4.1. Policy Information SOAP API**

- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/policies`
- **Description**: Retrieves detailed information for a specific policy.

**Sample SOAP Request**:
```xml
POST /api/v1/policies HTTP/1.1
Host: api.libertymutual.com
Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8

<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <soap:Body>
    <GetPolicyInfo xmlns="http://libertymutual.com/policies">
      <policyId>abc123</policyId>
    </GetPolicyInfo>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

**Sample SOAP Response**:
```xml
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
  <soap:Body>
    <GetPolicyInfoResponse xmlns="http://libertymutual.com/policies">
      <policy>
        <policyId>abc123</policyId>
        <policyType>Auto</policyType>
        <premium>1200.00</premium>
        <startDate>2024-01-01</startDate>
        <endDate>2025-01-01</endDate>
        <status>Active</status>
      </policy>
    </GetPolicyInfoResponse>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```
