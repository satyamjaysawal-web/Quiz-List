Haan, "checks" ke alawa kuch aur terms bhi hain jo similar concept ko refer karte hain:

1. **Validations**: Iska use specific inputs ya values ko validate karne ke liye hota hai, taaki woh expected format aur constraints mein ho.
  
2. **Assertions**: Yeh code mein specific conditions ko ensure karte hain. Agar condition galat hoti hai, to error raise ho jaata hai. Assertions kaafi common hain testing aur debugging mein.
  
3. **Safeguards**: Yeh term un protective measures ke liye use hoti hai jo code ko unexpected situations aur failures se safe rakhti hain.
  
4. **Defensive Code/Programming**: Yeh ek approach hai jisme code aise likha jaata hai ki woh har tarah ke unexpected inputs aur edge cases ke against resilient ho.
  
5. **Preconditions**: Yeh wo conditions hain jo kisi bhi function ya code block ke chalne se pehle check ki jaati hain, taaki ensure ho sake ki inputs aur state sahi hai.
  
6. **Error Handling Mechanisms**: Yeh general term un sab techniques ke liye hai jo code ko errors aur exceptions se bachane ke liye use hoti hain.

Yeh sab terms alag-alag context mein thoda specific ho sakti hain, par broadly yeh sab concepts validation aur handling ko refer karte hain jo code ko robust banate hain.

Hereâ€™s a table that summarizes the checks, validations, and restrictions for implementing a secure and compliant AI text search and output system:

| **Category**               | **Check / Validation**                        | **Description**                                                                                       |
