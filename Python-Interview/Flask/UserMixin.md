The `UserMixin` class from **Flask-Login** provides several **inbuilt methods** that are automatically added to your `User` class. These methods are essential for user authentication, session management, and checking the status of a user (whether they're logged in, active, anonymous, etc.).

Here is a breakdown of the most commonly used **inbuilt methods** from `UserMixin`:

### 1. **`is_authenticated`**
   - **Purpose**: Returns `True` if the user is authenticated, i.e., logged in.
   - **Default Behavior**: This is `True` if the user has logged in, and `False` otherwise.
   - **When to Use**: This method is useful when you want to check if the current user is authenticated, usually before allowing access to restricted routes.

   **Example**:
   ```python
   if current_user.is_authenticated:
       # Allow access to a restricted page
   ```

### 2. **`is_active`**
   - **Purpose**: Returns `True` if the user is active. You can override this method if you need to deactivate a user account (e.g., if an account is suspended or deleted).
   - **Default Behavior**: By default, this is always `True` because Flask-Login doesn't track whether a user is active or not unless you implement it in your `User` class.
   - **When to Use**: This method is used to check if a user is allowed to interact with the system (e.g., after login, for non-suspended users).

   **Example**:
   ```python
   if current_user.is_active:
       # User is active, proceed with the request
   ```

### 3. **`is_anonymous`**
   - **Purpose**: Returns `True` if the user is anonymous, i.e., not logged in. It is the opposite of `is_authenticated`.
   - **Default Behavior**: By default, this returns `False` for authenticated users and `True` for non-authenticated (anonymous) users.
   - **When to Use**: This method is used when you need to check if the current user is not logged in or is an anonymous user.

   **Example**:
   ```python
   if current_user.is_anonymous:
       # User is not logged in, redirect to login page
   ```

### 4. **`get_id()`**
   - **Purpose**: Returns the **unique identifier** of the user. This identifier can be any value you use to uniquely identify a user (e.g., a username, email, or user ID).
   - **Default Behavior**: Returns `str(self.id)`. In your `User` class, `id` should be a unique value (e.g., username or user ID).
   - **When to Use**: This is the method Flask-Login uses to store the user’s identifier in the session, and it’s also used during the login process to identify the user.

   **Example**:
   ```python
   user_id = current_user.get_id()  # Get the current user's unique identifier
   ```

### 5. **`set_password()` (Not from `UserMixin`, but a common custom method)**
   - **Purpose**: While not part of `UserMixin`, many people create this method to hash and set the password for users. You can use **Flask-Bcrypt** or **Werkzeug** to hash passwords.
   - **When to Use**: This method is usually added manually to the `User` class, as it's needed when you want to securely store and compare passwords.

   **Example**:
   ```python
   from flask_bcrypt import Bcrypt
   bcrypt = Bcrypt()

   class User(UserMixin):
       def __init__(self, id, password):
           self.id = id
           self.password_hash = self.set_password(password)

       def set_password(self, password):
           return bcrypt.generate_password_hash(password).decode('utf-8')

       def check_password(self, password):
           return bcrypt.check_password_hash(self.password_hash, password)
   ```

### 6. **`get_user()` (Custom method, not part of `UserMixin`)**
   - **Purpose**: Often used in conjunction with `user_loader` in Flask-Login to fetch the user from a database or another storage system.
   - **When to Use**: Used in the `user_loader` function to load the user by their ID, which Flask-Login stores in the session.

   **Example**:
   ```python
   @login_manager.user_loader
   def load_user(user_id):
       return User.get(user_id)  # Fetch the user from a database or storage
   ```

### Recap of `UserMixin` Inbuilt Methods

Here are the core **inbuilt methods** provided by `UserMixin` in Flask-Login:

| Method             | Description                                               | Default Behavior                                   |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `is_authenticated` | Returns `True` if the user is authenticated (logged in).  | `True` for logged-in users, `False` otherwise.     |
| `is_active`        | Returns `True` if the user is active.                     | `True` by default (you can override this).         |
| `is_anonymous`     | Returns `True` if the user is anonymous (not logged in).  | `False` for authenticated users, `True` otherwise. |
| `get_id()`         | Returns the unique identifier of the user.                | Returns the `id` as a string.                      |

### Example Usage in a Flask Application:
```python
from flask_login import LoginManager, UserMixin, login_user, login_required, current_user, logout_user

# Flask-Login initialization
login_manager = LoginManager()

class User(UserMixin):
    def __init__(self, id):
        self.id = id

# This function is called to load a user from the session
@login_manager.user_loader
def load_user(user_id):
    return User(user_id)

# Routes for login/logout
@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    user = User('john_doe')  # Create or fetch the user from database
    login_user(user)
    return "Logged in!"

@app.route('/profile')
@login_required
def profile():
    return f"Hello, {current_user.id}!"  # Accessing the user ID

@app.route('/logout')
def logout():
    logout_user()
    return "Logged out!"
```

In this example:
- **`login_user()`** logs the user in by saving their session data.
- **`current_user`** gives access to the logged-in user and their `UserMixin` methods (`is_authenticated`, `get_id()`, etc.).
- **`login_required`** ensures that a user must be logged in to access the `/profile` page.

### Customization:

- You can **override** `is_authenticated`, `is_active`, or `get_id()` in your custom `User` class if you need additional logic.
  
For example, if you want to implement an `is_active` method based on whether the user has confirmed their email, you could override it:

```python
class User(UserMixin):
    def __init__(self, id, email_confirmed):
        self.id = id
        self.email_confirmed = email_confirmed

    def is_active(self):
        return self.email_confirmed
```

In conclusion, `UserMixin` provides essential methods for integrating Flask-Login with your user management system, handling authentication, and tracking the logged-in state.

Sure! Let's dive into examples to better explain the difference between using and not using `UserMixin` in Flask-Login.

### Example 1: Without `UserMixin`

Here, we implement all the necessary methods manually for a custom `User` class.

```python
from flask_login import LoginManager

# Custom User class without using UserMixin
class User:
    def __init__(self, id, active=True, authenticated=False):
        self.id = id  # Unique identifier for the user (could be username, email, etc.)
        self.active = active  # Whether the user is active (not banned, for example)
        self.authenticated = authenticated  # Whether the user is authenticated (logged in)

    # Manually implement is_authenticated
    def is_authenticated(self):
        return self.authenticated  # Returns True if the user is logged in

    # Manually implement is_active
    def is_active(self):
        return self.active  # Returns True if the user is not suspended or banned

    # Manually implement is_anonymous
    def is_anonymous(self):
        return not self.authenticated  # Returns True if the user is not logged in

    # Manually implement get_id
    def get_id(self):
        return str(self.id)  # Return the user's unique identifier (could be an ID or username)

# Example of how the User class would be used:
user = User(id='user123', active=True, authenticated=True)
print(user.is_authenticated())  # True
print(user.is_active())  # True
print(user.is_anonymous())  # False
print(user.get_id())  # 'user123'
```

#### Explanation:
- `is_authenticated`: Returns whether the user is logged in.
- `is_active`: Returns whether the user is active (not banned).
- `is_anonymous`: Returns whether the user is logged out (anonymous).
- `get_id`: Returns the user ID (used by Flask-Login to identify the user).

### Example 2: With `UserMixin`

Now, let's use `UserMixin` to automatically handle the common methods for user authentication.

```python
from flask_login import UserMixin

# Custom User class using UserMixin
class User(UserMixin):
    def __init__(self, id, active=True, authenticated=False):
        self.id = id  # Unique identifier for the user
        self.active = active  # Whether the user is active (not banned)
        self.authenticated = authenticated  # Whether the user is authenticated (logged in)

# Example of how the User class would be used:
user = User(id='user123', active=True, authenticated=True)
print(user.is_authenticated())  # True (this is provided by UserMixin)
print(user.is_active())  # True (this is provided by UserMixin)
print(user.is_anonymous())  # False (this is provided by UserMixin)
print(user.get_id())  # 'user123' (this is provided by UserMixin)
```

#### Explanation:
- By inheriting from `UserMixin`, we don’t need to manually implement the methods (`is_authenticated`, `is_active`, `is_anonymous`, `get_id`) because **`UserMixin` provides default implementations** of these methods.
- We still have the flexibility to add additional custom logic if needed (e.g., overriding `is_active`), but in most cases, the default implementations from `UserMixin` are sufficient.

### Comparing Both Approaches

| Feature/Method           | Without `UserMixin`                                        | With `UserMixin`                                         |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **`is_authenticated()`**  | Manually implemented to check if the user is logged in.   | Automatically provided by `UserMixin`.                  |
| **`is_active()`**         | Manually implemented to check if the user is active.      | Automatically provided by `UserMixin`.                  |
| **`is_anonymous()`**      | Manually implemented to check if the user is anonymous.   | Automatically provided by `UserMixin`.                  |
| **`get_id()`**            | Manually implemented to return the user’s unique ID.      | Automatically provided by `UserMixin`.                  |
| **Customization**         | Full control over each method, can be customized freely.  | Methods can be overridden if needed.                    |
| **Simplicity**            | Requires more code to manage authentication logic.       | Provides simplicity by automatically handling common methods. |

### Why Use `UserMixin`?

- **Convenience**: If you don’t need to customize the behavior of the authentication methods, `UserMixin` saves time and reduces boilerplate code.
- **Flexibility**: You still have the option to override any of the default methods from `UserMixin` if you want to add custom behavior (e.g., checking a database to verify user status).
  
### Example with Method Customization (Override)

If you want to add some custom behavior while still using `UserMixin`, you can override the methods.

```python
from flask_login import UserMixin

# Custom User class with `UserMixin` and an overridden method
class User(UserMixin):
    def __init__(self, id, active=True, authenticated=False, role=None):
        self.id = id
        self.active = active
        self.authenticated = authenticated
        self.role = role  # Custom attribute to store user role (admin, user, etc.)

    # Override is_active to add custom logic based on role
    def is_active(self):
        # Check if the user is active and has the 'admin' role
        if self.role == 'admin':
            return True  # Admin users are always active
        return self.active  # Normal users depend on active status

# Example usage:
user1 = User(id='user123', active=False, role='admin')
user2 = User(id='user456', active=False, role='user')

print(user1.is_active())  # True (admin is always active)
print(user2.is_active())  # False (user is not active)
```

In this example, **`is_active`** was overridden to give special treatment to users with the `'admin'` role. Flask-Login's default behavior for `is_active` checks only the active attribute, but we customized it to consider the role of the user.

### Conclusion:

- **Without `UserMixin`**: You have to manually define methods like `is_authenticated()`, `is_active()`, `is_anonymous()`, and `get_id()`.
- **With `UserMixin`**: You get these methods automatically, saving you from writing repetitive code. However, you still have the option to override them if needed for custom behavior.

Using `UserMixin` is recommended when you don't need much customization, as it simplifies your code while providing the necessary functionality.
