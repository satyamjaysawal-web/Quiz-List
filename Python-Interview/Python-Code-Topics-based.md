Sure! Here’s a breakdown of the core concepts in Python along with examples and outputs for each:

### 1. Variables
Variables are used to store data values.

```python
# Example of variables
name = "Alice"
age = 30
height = 5.5

# Output
print(name)  # Alice
print(age)   # 30
print(height)  # 5.5
```

### 2. Data Types
Python has several built-in data types:

- **int**: Integer values
- **float**: Floating point numbers
- **str**: Strings
- **list**: Ordered collection of items
- **dict**: Key-value pairs
- **set**: Unordered collection of unique items
- **tuple**: Ordered immutable collection of items

```python
# Example of different data types
integer_value = 42               # int
float_value = 3.14               # float
string_value = "Hello, World!"    # str
list_value = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]     # list
dict_value = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}  # dict
set_value = {1, 2, 3, 3}         # set
tuple_value = (1, 2, 3)          # tuple

# Output
print(integer_value)  # 42
print(float_value)    # 3.14
print(string_value)   # Hello, World!
print(list_value)     # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(dict_value)     # {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
print(set_value)      # {1, 2, 3}
print(tuple_value)    # (1, 2, 3)
```

### 3. Control Flow
Control flow statements allow for decision making in your code.

```python
# Example of control flow
number = 10

if number > 0:
    result = "Positive"
elif number < 0:
    result = "Negative"
else:
    result = "Zero"

# Output
print(result)  # Positive
```

### 4. Loops
Loops are used for iterating over a sequence.

- **For Loop**: Used to iterate over a sequence (like a list or string).
- **While Loop**: Repeats as long as a condition is true.

```python
# Example of for loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# Output
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4

# Example of while loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

# Output
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
```

### 5. Functions
Functions are reusable pieces of code that perform a specific task.

- **Defining a function**: Using the `def` keyword.
- **Lambda function**: An anonymous function defined with the `lambda` keyword.

```python
# Example of a regular function
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Example of a lambda function
multiply = lambda x, y: x * y

# Output
print(add(5, 3))        # 8
print(multiply(5, 3))   # 15
```

### 6. Scope
Scope refers to the visibility of variables. Python has global and local scope.

```python
# Example of scope
x = "global"

def my_function():
    global x
    x = "local"
    print("Inside function:", x)

my_function()
print("Outside function:", x)

# Output
# Inside function: local
# Outside function: local
```

### 7. List Comprehensions
List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.

```python
# Example of list comprehensions
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

# Output
print(squares)  # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

### Summary
The above examples cover basic concepts in Python, such as variables, data types, control flow, loops, functions, scope, and list comprehensions, providing a foundation for more complex programming tasks.

Here’s an overview of various data structures in Python, along with examples and their outputs:

### 1. Lists
Lists are ordered, mutable collections of items.

```python
# Example of a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Adding an item
fruits.append("orange")

# Output
print(fruits)  # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']

# Accessing items
print(fruits[1])  # banana

# Removing an item
fruits.remove("banana")

# Output
print(fruits)  # ['apple', 'cherry', 'orange']
```

### 2. Tuples
Tuples are ordered, immutable collections of items.

```python
# Example of a tuple
coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)

# Accessing items
print(coordinates[0])  # 10.0

# Tuples cannot be changed
# coordinates[0] = 5.0  # This would raise a TypeError

# Output
print(coordinates)  # (10.0, 20.0)
```

### 3. Sets
Sets are unordered collections of unique items.

```python
# Example of a set
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}

# Output
print(my_set)  # {1, 2, 3, 4}

# Adding an item
my_set.add(5)

# Removing an item
my_set.remove(2)

# Output
print(my_set)  # {1, 3, 4, 5}
```

### 4. Dictionaries
Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs.

```python
# Example of a dictionary
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}

# Accessing a value
print(my_dict["name"])  # Alice

# Adding a new key-value pair
my_dict["city"] = "New York"

# Output
print(my_dict)  # {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}

# Removing a key-value pair
del my_dict["age"]

# Output
print(my_dict)  # {'name': 'Alice', 'city': 'New York'}
```

### 5. Arrays (Using `array` Module)
The `array` module provides a way to create arrays with a specific data type.

```python
import array

# Example of an array
arr = array.array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4])  # 'i' indicates an array of integers

# Adding an item
arr.append(5)

# Output
print(arr)  # array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Accessing an item
print(arr[2])  # 3
```

### 6. Stacks
Stacks follow the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. You can use a list to implement a stack.

```python
# Example of a stack
stack = []

# Push items onto the stack
stack.append(1)
stack.append(2)
stack.append(3)

# Pop an item from the stack
last_item = stack.pop()

# Output
print(stack)       # [1, 2]
print(last_item)  # 3
```

### 7. Queues
Queues follow the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. You can use the `collections.deque` for an efficient queue implementation.

```python
from collections import deque

# Example of a queue
queue = deque()

# Enqueue items
queue.append(1)
queue.append(2)
queue.append(3)

# Dequeue an item
first_item = queue.popleft()

# Output
print(queue)       # deque([2, 3])
print(first_item)  # 1
```

### 8. Linked Lists
Python doesn’t have a built-in linked list, but you can create one using a class.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
            return
        last = self.head
        while last.next:
            last = last.next
        last.next = new_node

    def print_list(self):
        current = self.head
        while current:
            print(current.data, end=" -> ")
            current = current.next
        print("None")

# Example of using a linked list
linked_list = LinkedList()
linked_list.append(1)
linked_list.append(2)
linked_list.append(3)

# Output
linked_list.print_list()  # 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> None
```

### 9. Heaps
Heaps can be implemented using the `heapq` module. Heaps are binary trees where the parent node is always less than or equal to its children (min-heap).

```python
import heapq

# Example of a min-heap
heap = []

# Adding elements to the heap
heapq.heappush(heap, 3)
heapq.heappush(heap, 1)
heapq.heappush(heap, 2)

# Output the heap
print(heap)  # [1, 3, 2]

# Pop the smallest element
smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)

# Output
print(smallest)  # 1
print(heap)      # [2, 3]
```

### Summary
These examples cover the primary data structures available in Python, showcasing their usage and behaviors. Understanding these data structures is crucial for effective programming and algorithm implementation.

Sure! Here’s an overview of Python modules and packages, including how to import them, create packages, use `pip` for package management, and manage virtual environments.

### 1. Importing Modules
In Python, you can import modules in several ways:

- **Using `import`**: This imports the entire module.
- **Using `from ... import`**: This imports specific attributes or functions from a module.

#### Example of Importing Modules

```python
# Importing the entire math module
import math

# Using a function from the math module
result = math.sqrt(16)

# Output
print(result)  # 4.0

# Importing specific functions from the math module
from math import pow, pi

# Using the imported functions
power_result = pow(2, 3)  # 2 raised to the power of 3
circle_area = pi * (5 ** 2)  # Area of a circle with radius 5

# Output
print(power_result)  # 8.0
print(circle_area)   # 78.53981633974483
```

### 2. Creating Packages
A package is a way of organizing related modules into a directory hierarchy. A package is simply a directory containing a special file named `__init__.py`.

#### Example of Creating a Package
1. Create a directory structure:
   ```
   mypackage/
       __init__.py
       module1.py
       module2.py
   ```

2. Content of `module1.py`:
   ```python
   def greet(name):
       return f"Hello, {name}!"
   ```

3. Content of `module2.py`:
   ```python
   def farewell(name):
       return f"Goodbye, {name}!"
   ```

4. Content of `__init__.py` (can be empty or contain initialization code):
   ```python
   # This file makes Python treat the directory as a package.
   ```

#### Using the Package
```python
# Importing the package and its modules
from mypackage.module1 import greet
from mypackage.module2 import farewell

# Output
print(greet("Alice"))  # Hello, Alice!
print(farewell("Alice"))  # Goodbye, Alice!
```

### 3. `__init__.py`
The `__init__.py` file is required to make Python treat the directory as a package. It can be empty or can be used to execute initialization code for the package.

```python
# Example content of __init__.py
print("Initializing mypackage")
```

### 4. `pip` (Package Installer)
`pip` is the package installer for Python, allowing you to install and manage additional libraries and dependencies that are not part of the Python standard library.

#### Installing Packages Using `pip`
To install a package, you can use the command line:

```bash
pip install requests
```

This installs the `requests` library, which is used for making HTTP requests.

### 5. `virtualenv`
`virtualenv` is a tool used to create isolated Python environments. This is useful for managing dependencies for different projects without conflicts.

#### Creating and Using a Virtual Environment
1. **Install `virtualenv`**:
   ```bash
   pip install virtualenv
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   virtualenv myenv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Deactivate the virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

### 6. `requirements.txt`
The `requirements.txt` file is used to specify the dependencies for a Python project. You can list the packages your project needs, and they can be installed with a single command.

#### Example of a `requirements.txt` File
```
requests==2.26.0
numpy==1.21.2
pandas==1.3.3
```

#### Installing Dependencies from `requirements.txt`
To install all the packages listed in `requirements.txt`, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Summary
This overview covers the basics of modules and packages in Python, including how to import them, create packages, manage dependencies with `pip`, and use `virtualenv` to maintain isolated environments. Understanding these concepts is essential for building and maintaining Python applications effectively.

Here’s a detailed overview of file handling in Python, including opening and closing files, reading and writing methods, file modes, and using context managers.

### 1. Open and Close Files
To work with files, you need to open them using the `open()` function and close them using the `close()` method.

```python
# Opening a file
file = open("example.txt", "w")  # Open in write mode

# Writing to the file
file.write("Hello, World!\n")
file.write("This is a sample file.")

# Closing the file
file.close()
```

### 2. Read/Write Methods

#### a. **`write()` Method**
The `write()` method is used to write data to a file.

```python
# Writing to a file
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("This is the first line.\n")
    file.write("This is the second line.\n")

# Output
print("Data written to the file.")
```

#### b. **`read()` Method**
The `read()` method reads the entire content of a file.

```python
# Reading from a file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()

# Output
print(content)
# This will print:
# This is the first line.
# This is the second line.
```

#### c. **`readline()` Method**
The `readline()` method reads a single line from a file.

```python
# Reading a file line by line
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    line1 = file.readline()
    line2 = file.readline()

# Output
print(line1.strip())  # This is the first line.
print(line2.strip())  # This is the second line.
```

#### d. **`readlines()` Method**
The `readlines()` method reads all the lines in a file and returns a list of lines.

```python
# Reading all lines at once
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()

# Output
for line in lines:
    print(line.strip())
# This will print:
# This is the first line.
# This is the second line.
```

### 3. File Modes
File modes determine the type of operations you can perform on the file:

- **`r`**: Read (default mode). Opens a file for reading, raises an error if the file does not exist.
- **`w`**: Write. Opens a file for writing, creates a new file or truncates the existing file.
- **`a`**: Append. Opens a file for appending, creates a new file if it does not exist.
- **`r+`**: Read and write. Opens a file for both reading and writing.
- **`w+`**: Write and read. Opens a file for both writing and reading, truncates the file.
- **`b`**: Binary mode. Used for binary files (e.g., images, audio).

#### Example of Different File Modes
```python
# Writing to a file in write mode
with open("example_w.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!\n")

# Appending to a file
with open("example_w.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("Appending a new line.\n")

# Reading from a file
with open("example_w.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()

print(content)
# Output:
# Hello, World!
# Appending a new line.
```

### 4. Context Managers (`with` Statement)
Using the `with` statement is a best practice for file handling. It ensures that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an error is raised.

```python
# Using context manager to open and write to a file
with open("example_context.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("This file is managed by a context manager.\n")

# No need to call file.close(), it's done automatically
```

### Summary
This overview covered file handling in Python, including how to open and close files, the various read/write methods, different file modes, and the use of context managers for cleaner and safer file operations. Proper file handling is essential for reading from and writing to files effectively and safely.

Here’s an overview of error handling in Python, including how to use try-except blocks, finally clauses, raising exceptions, custom exceptions, and assertions.

### 1. Try-Except Blocks
The `try` block allows you to test a block of code for errors, while the `except` block lets you handle those errors.

```python
# Example of try-except block
try:
    result = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You cannot divide by zero!")

# Output
# You cannot divide by zero!
```

### 2. Finally Clause
The `finally` clause is executed regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. It is often used for cleanup actions.

```python
# Example of try-except-finally
try:
    file = open("example.txt", "r")
    content = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("The file does not exist.")
finally:
    # This block will execute no matter what
    print("Executing finally clause.")
    if 'file' in locals():
        file.close()  # Ensure the file is closed if it was opened

# Output
# The file does not exist.
# Executing finally clause.
```

### 3. Raising Exceptions
You can raise exceptions manually using the `raise` keyword. This is useful for enforcing certain conditions in your code.

```python
# Example of raising an exception
def divide(x, y):
    if y == 0:
        raise ValueError("The denominator cannot be zero!")
    return x / y

try:
    result = divide(10, 0)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)

# Output
# The denominator cannot be zero!
```

### 4. Custom Exceptions
You can create your own exceptions by defining a new class that inherits from the built-in `Exception` class.

```python
# Example of a custom exception
class MyCustomError(Exception):
    pass

def check_positive(number):
    if number < 0:
        raise MyCustomError("Negative numbers are not allowed!")

try:
    check_positive(-5)
except MyCustomError as e:
    print(e)

# Output
# Negative numbers are not allowed!
```

### 5. Assertions
Assertions are a way to test if a condition in your code returns True. If it does not, an `AssertionError` is raised. This is mainly used for debugging purposes.

```python
# Example of an assertion
def square_root(x):
    assert x >= 0, "Cannot compute the square root of a negative number"
    return x ** 0.5

try:
    print(square_root(-9))
except AssertionError as e:
    print(e)

# Output
# Cannot compute the square root of a negative number
```

### Summary

This overview covers error handling in Python using try-except blocks, finally clauses, raising exceptions, creating custom exceptions, and using assertions. Proper error handling is essential for writing robust and user-friendly applications, as it allows you to gracefully manage unexpected conditions and maintain the flow of your program.

Here's a comprehensive overview of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python, including classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, method overriding, and magic methods (also known as dunder methods).

### 1. Classes and Objects

**Classes** are blueprints for creating objects (instances). An **object** is an instance of a class.

```python
# Example of a class and object
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Instance variable
        self.age = age

    def bark(self):
        return "Woof!"

# Creating an object of the Dog class
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)

# Accessing attributes and methods
print(my_dog.name)  # Output: Buddy
print(my_dog.age)   # Output: 3
print(my_dog.bark())  # Output: Woof!
```

### 2. Inheritance
**Inheritance** allows a class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class).

```python
# Example of inheritance
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        return "Animal speaks"

class Cat(Animal):  # Cat inherits from Animal
    def meow(self):
        return "Meow!"

# Creating an object of the Cat class
my_cat = Cat()
print(my_cat.speak())  # Output: Animal speaks
print(my_cat.meow())    # Output: Meow!
```

### 3. Encapsulation
**Encapsulation** is the practice of restricting access to certain attributes and methods to protect the integrity of the object. In Python, this is achieved using private variables (prefixing with an underscore `_`).

```python
# Example of encapsulation
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance):
        self.owner = owner
        self.__balance = balance  # Private variable

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.__balance += amount
            return self.__balance
        else:
            return "Invalid deposit amount"

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

# Creating a BankAccount object
account = BankAccount("Alice", 1000)

# Accessing public methods
print(account.deposit(500))  # Output: 1500
print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1500

# Trying to access the private variable directly will raise an AttributeError
# print(account.__balance)  # Uncommenting this line will raise an error
```

### 4. Polymorphism
**Polymorphism** allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, typically achieved through method overriding.

```python
# Example of polymorphism
class Bird:
    def speak(self):
        return "Chirp!"

class Dog:
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

def animal_sound(animal):
    print(animal.speak())

# Using polymorphism
my_bird = Bird()
my_dog = Dog()

animal_sound(my_bird)  # Output: Chirp!
animal_sound(my_dog)   # Output: Woof!
```

### 5. Method Overriding
**Method overriding** allows a child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.

```python
# Example of method overriding
class Vehicle:
    def start(self):
        return "Vehicle starting"

class Car(Vehicle):
    def start(self):  # Overriding the start method
        return "Car starting"

# Creating objects
my_vehicle = Vehicle()
my_car = Car()

print(my_vehicle.start())  # Output: Vehicle starting
print(my_car.start())      # Output: Car starting
```

### 6. Magic Methods (Dunder Methods)
**Magic methods**, also known as **dunder methods** (double underscore methods), allow you to define the behavior of objects for built-in functions. Common examples include `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`, `__len__`, and `__add__`.

```python
# Example of magic methods
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Point({self.x}, {self.y})"

    def __add__(self, other):
        return Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)

    def __len__(self):
        return int((self.x ** 2 + self.y ** 2) ** 0.5)

# Creating Point objects
point1 = Point(2, 3)
point2 = Point(5, 7)

# Using magic methods
print(point1)              # Output: Point(2, 3)
print(point2)              # Output: Point(5, 7)
print(point1 + point2)     # Output: Point(7, 10)
print(len(point1))         # Output: 3
```

Here's a comprehensive overview of functional programming concepts in Python, including first-class functions, higher-order functions, `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, and lambda functions.

### 1. First-Class Functions
In Python, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be treated like any other variable. You can assign functions to variables, pass them as arguments to other functions, and return them from functions.

```python
# Example of first-class functions
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Assigning a function to a variable
greeting = greet

# Calling the function
print(greeting("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

### 2. Higher-Order Functions
Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results. This allows for greater abstraction and modularity in your code.

```python
# Example of a higher-order function
def apply_function(func, value):
    return func(value)

# Defining a simple function
def square(x):
    return x ** 2

# Using the higher-order function
result = apply_function(square, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 25
```

### 3. `map()`
The `map()` function applies a given function to all items in an iterable (like a list) and returns a map object (which can be converted to a list).

```python
# Example of map()
def square(x):
    return x ** 2

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squared_numbers = list(map(square, numbers))
print(squared_numbers)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]
```

### 4. `filter()`
The `filter()` function filters elements from an iterable based on a function that returns True or False. It returns an iterator that can be converted to a list.

```python
# Example of filter()
def is_even(x):
    return x % 2 == 0

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
even_numbers = list(filter(is_even, numbers))
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

### 5. `reduce()`
The `reduce()` function, found in the `functools` module, applies a rolling computation to sequential pairs of values in an iterable. It is useful for aggregating results.

```python
from functools import reduce

# Example of reduce()
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
sum_result = reduce(add, numbers)
print(sum_result)  # Output: 10
```

### 6. Lambda Functions
Lambda functions are small anonymous functions defined using the `lambda` keyword. They can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression.

```python
# Example of lambda functions
# Lambda function for squaring a number
square = lambda x: x ** 2
print(square(5))  # Output: 25

# Using lambda with map
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))
print(squared_numbers)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]

# Using lambda with filter
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4]
```

### Summary
This overview covers key concepts in functional programming using Python, including first-class functions, higher-order functions, `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, and lambda functions. Understanding these concepts can lead to more concise and readable code, leveraging the power of functional programming paradigms.

Regular expressions (regex) are a powerful tool for searching and manipulating strings based on patterns. In Python, the `re` module provides a wide range of functionalities for working with regex patterns. Here’s an overview of the key concepts and methods available in the `re` module, including patterns, search, match, substitute, and split operations.

### 1. The `re` Module
To work with regular expressions in Python, you first need to import the `re` module.

```python
import re
```

### 2. Patterns
A pattern is a sequence of characters that defines a search criterion. Common patterns include:

- `\d` for digits
- `\w` for word characters (alphanumeric + underscore)
- `\s` for whitespace characters
- `.` for any character except a newline
- `^` for the start of a string
- `$` for the end of a string
- `*`, `+`, `?` for quantifiers

### 3. Search
The `re.search()` function scans through a string looking for the first location where the regex pattern produces a match. It returns a match object if found, or `None` if not.

```python
# Example of re.search()
text = "The rain in Spain"
match = re.search(r"rain", text)

if match:
    print("Match found:", match.group())  # Output: Match found: rain
else:
    print("No match found.")
```

### 4. Match
The `re.match()` function checks for a match only at the beginning of the string. If the pattern is found at the start, it returns a match object; otherwise, it returns `None`.

```python
# Example of re.match()
text = "The rain in Spain"
match = re.match(r"The", text)

if match:
    print("Match found:", match.group())  # Output: Match found: The
else:
    print("No match found.")

# Checking for a pattern that doesn't match at the start
match = re.match(r"rain", text)
print(match)  # Output: None (no match)
```

### 5. Substitute
The `re.sub()` function replaces occurrences of the pattern with a specified replacement string.

```python
# Example of re.sub()
text = "The rain in Spain"
result = re.sub(r"rain", "sun", text)
print(result)  # Output: The sun in Spain
```

### 6. Split
The `re.split()` function splits a string by the occurrences of the pattern.

```python
# Example of re.split()
text = "apple, banana; cherry orange"
result = re.split(r"[;,\s]+", text)  # Split by semicolon, comma, or whitespace
print(result)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']
```

### Summary
The `re` module in Python is a powerful tool for working with regular expressions, allowing you to search, match, substitute, and split strings based on patterns. Understanding these functions can greatly enhance your ability to handle text processing tasks effectively. Here's a quick recap of the key functions:

- **`re.search()`**: Finds the first occurrence of a pattern in a string.
- **`re.match()`**: Checks if a pattern matches at the beginning of a string.
- **`re.sub()`**: Replaces occurrences of a pattern in a string.
- **`re.split()`**: Splits a string by a specified pattern.

These functions allow you to perform complex string operations with relative ease, making regex an invaluable tool in Python programming.
