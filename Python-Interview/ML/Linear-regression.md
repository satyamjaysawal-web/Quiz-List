**Linear Regression** is a statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It's widely used in predictive analysis and machine learning for tasks like forecasting and trend analysis. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of key topics and terms associated with linear regression:

| **Category**                | **Term/Topic**                                                                                           |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **Types of Linear Regression** | Simple Linear Regression (1 independent variable), Multiple Linear Regression (multiple independent variables) |
| **Mathematical Model**      | Regression Equation (y = mx + c), Slope (m), Intercept (c), Coefficients                                |

| **Common Use Cases**        | Predicting Sales, Trend Analysis, Pricing Optimization, Demand Forecasting                              |
| **Data Preprocessing**      | Standardization, Normalization, Handling Multicollinearity, Removing Outliers                           |
| **Multicollinearity Detection** | Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), Correlation Matrix                                                  |
| **Advanced Variants**       | Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization), Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization), Elastic Net                 |
| **Regularization**          | L1 Regularization (Lasso), L2 Regularization (Ridge)                                                    |
| **Python Libraries**        | scikit-learn (LinearRegression), statsmodels (for detailed stats and diagnostics), pandas, numpy        |
| **Implementation Steps**    | Data Collection, Exploratory Data Analysis, Model Training, Model Evaluation, Model Tuning              |
| **Overfitting/Underfitting** | Model Complexity, Regularization Techniques, Cross-Validation                                          |

In **simple linear regression**, the model aims to find a straight line that best fits the data by minimizing the distance between the data points and the line. In **multiple linear regression**, the relationship between multiple variables and a dependent variable is modeled.
