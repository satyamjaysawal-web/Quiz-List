In English grammar, "I am" is a statement of fact and indicates certainty or a current state. In contrast, using "If I were" creates a hypothetical or subjunctive mood, often expressing something contrary to reality, a wish, or a hypothetical situation.

Here’s how they differ:

- **"I am"**: Indicates certainty and reality, a state that is true or considered factual.
  - Example: *I am a teacher.* (This is a statement of fact.)

- **"If I were"**: This phrasing introduces a condition or an imagined scenario, often used for hypothetical or counterfactual statements.
  - Example: *If I were a teacher, I would teach history.* (This imagines a scenario where the speaker is a teacher, even though they aren’t.)

The subjunctive "If I were" is often used in these types of sentences:

1. **Wishes**: *If I were rich, I’d travel the world.*
2. **Hypotheticals**: *If I were in your shoes, I’d take the job.*
3. **Conditions**: *If I were to study more, I might pass the exam.*

Using "If I was" instead of "If I were" is also common in informal English, though "If I were" is more grammatically standard for hypothetical scenarios.
