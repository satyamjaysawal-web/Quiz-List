A movie app can have multiple ways for users to select or discover movies. Here are several approaches:

### 1. **Genre-Based Selection**
   - Users can browse or filter movies based on genres like *Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi, Romance, Comedy, Thriller*, etc.
   - A genre filter will allow users to narrow down movies to the type they prefer.
   - Option to select multiple genres for movies with mixed themes (like *Action-Comedy*).

### 2. **Search by Title or Keywords**
   - A simple search bar where users can type the movie's title or keywords from the description.
   - The app can provide suggestions or autocomplete as the user types.

### 3. **Director-Based Browsing**
   - Users can choose to explore movies by their favorite directors.
   - An option to list all movies from a selected director.

### 4. **Actor-Based Browsing**
   - Users can search for movies starring specific actors or actresses.
   - It could include a dedicated section for "Popular Actors" or "Trending Stars" for quick selection.

### 5. **Year-Based Filter**
   - Users can filter or search movies based on the release year or a specific time range.
   - Option to explore movies released in a particular decade (like *2000s* or *2010s*).

### 6. **Movie Rating Filter**
   - Users can filter movies based on IMDb ratings (e.g., only show movies with a rating of 7.0 and above).
   - An advanced filter for specific rating ranges (like 7.0 to 8.0, 8.1 and above).

### 7. **User Votes Filter**
   - Allow users to filter based on the number of votes a movie has received (e.g., only movies with over 100,000 votes).
   - This helps in identifying popular or well-reviewed movies.

### 8. **Revenue-Based Filter**
   - Option to explore movies based on box-office success, filtering by revenue (e.g., movies earning over $100 million).
   - Useful for users interested in blockbuster movies.

### 9. **Runtime-Based Selection**
   - Users can filter movies based on runtime, like *short movies* (<90 mins), *standard length* (90-120 mins), or *long movies* (>120 mins).
   - Useful when users want to pick a movie that fits their available viewing time.

### 10. **Metascore-Based Selection**
   - A filter to select movies based on Metascore (e.g., movies with a Metascore of 70 and above).
   - Helps in finding critically acclaimed movies.

### 11. **Popular & Trending Movies**
   - A section for currently trending movies based on recent popularity.
   - Option to see the "Top 10" or "Most Watched" movies in the app.

### 12. **Personalized Recommendations**
   - Recommendations based on user history and preferences.
   - Uses machine learning algorithms to suggest movies similar to what the user has liked before.
   - "Because you watched" or "Recommended for You" sections.

### 13. **Mood-Based Suggestions**
   - Movies categorized by user mood, such as *Feel-Good, Dark, Exciting, Romantic*.
   - Provides recommendations based on how the user feels.

### 14. **New Releases**
   - A dedicated section for newly released movies.
   - Includes upcoming releases or recently added movies.

### 15. **Top Rated / Highest Rated**
   - A list of top-rated movies overall or within a specific genre.
   - "Highest Rated of All Time" or "Top Rated this Year" options.

### 16. **Collections & Playlists**
   - Curated collections based on themes, events, or occasions (e.g., *Christmas Movies, Superhero Movies*).
   - User-created or app-created playlists, such as *Best of 2023, Oscar Winners*.

### 17. **Watchlist & Favorites**
   - Users can create a personal watchlist or mark movies as favorites.
   - Options to view and pick from a "Saved Movies" list.

### 18. **Movie Posters / Images / Thumbnails**
   - Grid or list view showing movie posters or thumbnails to help visually browse.
   - Hover or click to see details or play a trailer.

### 19. **Trailers & Sneak Peeks**
   - Allow users to watch trailers or preview clips before making a selection.
   - Trailers can be a deciding factor in whether to watch the movie.

### 20. **Social Recommendations**
   - Recommendations based on friends' activity, ratings, or reviews.
   - Integration with social media platforms or a social feed within the app.

### 21. **Voice Search**
   - Users can use voice commands to search for a movie by title, genre, or even say something like *"Show me a good comedy from 2015"*.

### 22. **Advanced Filters & Sorting**
   - Combination filters allowing users to sort movies by multiple criteria simultaneously (e.g., *2010 Action movies with IMDb rating above 7.5*).
   - Sorting options by *year, rating, popularity, revenue,* etc.

### 23. **Location-Based Content**
   - Suggestions based on user location or language preferences.
   - Local content or regional hits for more personalized selection.

### 24. **User Reviews & Comments**
   - Users can browse user reviews or community ratings before selecting a movie.
   - Sorting by *Most Liked* reviews, *Newest* reviews, etc.

### 25. **Random Movie Selector**
   - A "Surprise Me" button to pick a random movie from the catalog.
   - Fun way to discover something unexpected.

By combining some of the methods mentioned above, users can have a seamless and tailored movie selection experience in the app.

To implement the requested features properly, we'll need to adjust the code to ensure proper user registration, login, and interaction for each endpoint (especially for reviewing, rating, and filtering). Here is the updated version with a few key changes:

1. **User Registration and Login**: I added routes for user registration and login with basic session management.
2. **Review and Rating**: Users can add reviews and ratings only if logged in.
3. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling and validation in API requests.
4. **General Improvements**: Updated the user data structure and ensured users can filter and perform other actions only after logging in.

Here is the updated code:

```python
import pandas as pd
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

# Load the dataset
movie_data = pd.read_csv('MovieDataset.csv')

# Preprocess the data

movie_data['Rating'] = pd.to_numeric(movie_data['Rating'], errors='coerce')
movie_data['Metascore'] = pd.to_numeric(movie_data['Metascore'], errors='coerce')
movie_data['Runtime (Minutes)'] = pd.to_numeric(movie_data['Runtime (Minutes)'], errors='coerce')

### Key Updates:
1. **User Authentication**: Implemented basic registration and login with in-memory storage for simplicity. In a real application, this should be integrated with a database and hashed password

 storage.
2. **Review and Rating**: Users can only add reviews and ratings after logging in.
3. **Watchlist Management**: Users can add movies to their watchlist, but only when logged in.
4. **Session Handling**: We track the logged-in user via the `current_user` variable.

This version should provide the basic functionalities you need. However, remember that in a production system, user authentication should be handled with proper security measures such as hashing passwords and using session management (e.g., JWT tokens).

To test the APIs using Postman, follow these steps for each of the key features:

### Step 1: Set up the Flask server

Before testing the APIs with Postman, make sure the Flask application is running. In your terminal, run:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start the server on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` by default.

---

```

---

#### **3. User Logout**
**Method**: `POST`  
**URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/logout`

}
```

---

#### **12. Add a Movie to Watchlist**
**Method**: `POST`  
**URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/testuser/watchlist`

**Body** (JSON):
```json
{
  "movie": "Guardians of the Galaxy"
}
```

- This will add the movie to the logged-in user's watchlist.
- The response will be:
```json
{
  "message": "Added to watchlist"
}

- The response will be:
```json
{
  "message": "Review added"
}
```

---

### Step 3: Review and Test Responses

- For each API, check the response status (e.g., 200 for success, 400 for errors).
- Make sure to test edge cases like invalid parameters, missing fields, and unauthorized requests (e.g., trying to add a review when not logged in).
- Verify that the returned JSON matches the expected output format and contains the correct data.

---

### Step 4: Example Postman Collection
Once you've tested each API, you can create a Postman collection to save these requests. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open Postman.
2. Click on "New" and then "Collection."
3. Add each of the above API requests to your collection by selecting "Add Request" for each one.
4. You can then export the collection and share it with others if needed.

---

This should give you a complete workflow for testing your Flask API with Postman. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
