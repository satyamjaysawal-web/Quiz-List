### Step 3: Review and Test Responses

- For each API, check the response status (e.g., 200 for success, 400 for errors).

- Verify that the returned JSON matches the expected output format and contains the correct data.

### Step 4: Example Postman Collection
Once you've tested each API, you can create a Postman collection to save these requests. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open Postman.
2. Click on "New" and then "Collection."
3. Add each of the above API requests to your collection by selecting "Add Request" for each one.
4. You can then export the collection and share it with others if needed.
