### **React Context API**

1. **Answer**:  
The **React Context API** is a method to pass **data globally** through a **React component tree**, allowing you to avoid "prop drilling" (passing props through multiple levels). It is typically used for **global state management**, such as themes, user authentication, or any data that many components need to access.

2. **Uses in short**:
   - **Global state management** (e.g., theme, user data)
   - **Avoiding prop drilling**
   - **Sharing state across deeply nested components**

3. **Types if available**:  
   - **Provider**: Wraps your component tree and provides the context.
   - **Consumer**: Accesses and uses the context data.
   - **useContext hook**: A hook to easily access context data in functional components.

4. **Example**:
   ```jsx
   import React, { useContext, useState } from 'react';

   // Step 1: Create a Context
   const ThemeContext = React.createContext();

   // Step 2: Create a Provider Component
   const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
     const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');

     return (
       <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>
         {children}
       </ThemeContext.Provider>
     );
   };

   // Step 3: Consume the context using useContext hook
   const ThemeButton = () => {
     const { theme, setTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext);

     return (
       <button
         onClick={() => setTheme(theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light')}
       >
         Toggle to {theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'} mode
       </button>
     );
   };

   const App = () => (
     <ThemeProvider>
       <div>
         <h1>Welcome to the App!</h1>
         <ThemeButton />
       </div>
     </ThemeProvider>
   );

   export default App;
   ```

   # Output:
   ```
   - Initial render will show a button saying "Toggle to dark mode".
   - On button click, the theme toggles between light and dark, changing the button text.
   ```

5. **Summary in table format**:

| **Aspect**              | **Description**                                                                                      |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**              | Provide a way to share global data (like state) without prop drilling                                |
| **Components**           | Provider, Consumer, useContext hook                                                                  |
| **Use cases**            | Global state (themes, user data), Avoiding prop drilling                                              |
| **Example**              | Created a theme toggle button using Context API and useContext hook                                  |
| **Advantages**           | Easy global state management, avoid prop drilling, simplifies passing data to deeply nested components|
| **Alternative to**       | Prop drilling, Redux (for basic global state needs)                                                  |
