**Axios** ek popular JavaScript library hai jo HTTP requests (jaise GET, POST) ko simplify karta hai. Iska use server se data fetch karne ya server ko data bhejne ke liye kiya jata hai.

**'https://api.example.com/data'** ko **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)** ya **API endpoint** kehte hain. Ye ek address hai jahan se client (browser ya app) data fetch ya send karta hai.

### **React Context API**

1. **Answer**:  
The **React Context API** is a method to pass **data globally** through a **React component tree**, allowing you to avoid "prop drilling" (passing props through multiple levels). It is typically used for **global state management**, such as themes, user authentication, or any data that many components need to access.

2. **Uses in short**:
   - **Global state management** (e.g., theme, user data)
   - **Avoiding prop drilling**
   - **Sharing state across deeply nested components**

3. **Types if available**:  
   - **Provider**: Wraps your component tree and provides the context.
   - **Consumer**: Accesses and uses the context data.
   - **useContext hook**: A hook to easily access context data in functional components.

4. **Example**:
   ```jsx
   import React, { useContext, useState } from 'react';

   // Step 1: Create a Context
   const ThemeContext = React.createContext();

   // Step 2: Create a Provider Component
   const ThemeProvider = ({ children }) => {
     const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');

     return (
       <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>
         {children}
       </ThemeContext.Provider>
     );
   };

   // Step 3: Consume the context using useContext hook
   const ThemeButton = () => {
     const { theme, setTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext);

     return (
       <button
         onClick={() => setTheme(theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light')}
       >
         Toggle to {theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'} mode
       </button>
     );
   };

   const App = () => (
     <ThemeProvider>
       <div>
         <h1>Welcome to the App!</h1>
         <ThemeButton />
       </div>
     </ThemeProvider>
   );

   export default App;
   ```

   # Output:
   ```
   - Initial render will show a button saying "Toggle to dark mode".
   - On button click, the theme toggles between light and dark, changing the button text.
   ```

| **Aspect**              | **Description**                                                                                      |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**              | Provide a way to share global data (like state) without prop drilling                                |
| **Components**           | Provider, Consumer, useContext hook                                                                  |
| **Use cases**            | Global state (themes, user data), Avoiding prop drilling                                              |

### 1. **Corrected Question:**

- Compare **Redux**, **React (useState & useContext)**, **Recoil**, and other popular state management libraries (like **MobX**, **Zustand**) in terms of **state management**.
- What are their **uses**, **pros & cons**, and how do they differ in terms of complexity and performance?

---

### 2. **Answer in Hinglish:**

State management kaafi important hota hai jab React applications complex hote hain. Har library/state management solution ke apne pros aur cons hote hain jo aapke use case ke basis par decide kiye jaate hain. Let's compare **Redux**, **React (useState & useContext)**, **Recoil**, and others like **MobX** and **Zustand**.

---

### 3. **Uses, Pros & Cons:**

#### **React (useState & useContext):**
1. **Uses**: Small and simple applications jisme bohot zyada global state ki zarurat nahi hoti.
2. **Pros**:
   - React ke built-in hooks hain, isliye koi external dependency nahi.
   - Simple use cases ke liye efficient aur fast.
   - Minimal boilerplate code.
3. **Cons**:
   - Large-scale apps me **prop drilling** ki dikkat ho sakti hai (passing props down multiple levels).
   - State ko **globally share** karna useContext ke saath limited hota hai.
   - Complex state logic ke liye cumbersome ho sakta hai.

#### **Redux**:
1. **Uses**: Large-scale apps jo predictable aur centralized state management chahte hain.
2. **Pros**:
   - **Predictable** state management (single source of truth).
   - **Time travel debugging** aur **devtools** ka support.
   - Strong ecosystem with middleware like **Redux Thunk**, **Saga** for async operations.
   - Ideal for large and complex apps.
3. **Cons**:
   - Bohot zyada **boilerplate** code (action, reducer, store setup).
   - Steeper learning curve, especially for beginners.
   - Redux Toolkit use karne se boilerplate kam hota hai, but still extra configuration hoti hai.

#### **Recoil**:
1. **Uses**: Modern React applications where we need efficient **global state management** with less boilerplate.
2. **Pros**:
   - Recoil **React ke saath deeply integrated** hai, aur isme less boilerplate code hota hai.
   - **Atoms** aur **Selectors** ki wajah se fine-grained state management aur derived state easy hota hai.
   - **Reactive state management** with automatic component updates.
   - Async state handling built-in with selectors.
3. **Cons**:
   - Still under development, so some advanced features ya stability issues ho sakti hain in very large projects.
   - Smaller ecosystem compared to Redux.

#### **MobX**:
1. **Uses**: Complex React apps jisme **observable state** chahiye aur Reactivity important hai.
2. **Pros**:
   - **Automatic tracking** of state changes (reactive state management).
   - Less boilerplate code compared to Redux.
   - Can be used in **object-oriented programming** style.
   - Best suited for apps with **highly dynamic** state.
3. **Cons**:
   - Can become difficult to manage in **large-scale applications**.
   - **Debugging** complex MobX code can sometimes be tricky.
   - Less predictable compared to Redux due to automatic state updates.

#### **Zustand**:
1. **Uses**: Simple, yet scalable state management solution for **small to medium-sized apps**.
2. **Pros**:
   - **Minimal boilerplate**, very simple API.
   - Uses **React hooks** for state, so it's simple and fast.
   - State can be shared globally without complexity.
   - Async logic support is built-in and easy to use.
3. **Cons**:
   - Smaller ecosystem compared to Redux.
   - Not as feature-rich for large, enterprise-level apps as Redux or MobX.

### 4. **Example of Comparison**:

Let's compare these libraries on how they manage a simple **counter** example:

#### **React (useState & useContext)** Example:

```javascript
// Counter with useState
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### **Redux Example**:

```javascript
// Redux Counter - action, reducer, store setup required
const incrementAction = { type: 'INCREMENT' };

function counterReducer(state = 0, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return state + 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

// Dispatch action and update state
store.dispatch(incrementAction);
console.log(store.getState());
```

#### **Recoil Example**:

```javascript
import { atom, useRecoilState } from 'recoil';

// Atom definition
const counterState = atom({
  key: 'counterState',
  default: 0,
});

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useRecoilState(counterState);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### **MobX Example**:

```javascript
import { observable } from 'mobx';

class CounterStore {
  @observable count = 0;

  increment() {
    this.count++;
  }
}

const store = new CounterStore();
store.increment();
console.log(store.count);  // Output: 1
```

#### **Zustand Example**:

```javascript
import create from 'zustand';

const useStore = create(set => ({
  count: 0,
  increment: () => set(state => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
}));

function Counter() {
  const { count, increment } = useStore();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{count}</h1>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 1. **Corrected Question:**

- How does **useReducer** compare with other state management solutions like **useState**, **useContext**, **Redux**, **Recoil**, **MobX**, and **Zustand**?
- What are the **uses**, **pros and cons**, and scenarios for using **useReducer**?

---

### 2. **Answer in Hinglish:**

`useReducer` React ka ek hook hai jo complex state logic ko manage karne ke liye use hota hai. Yeh `useState` se zyada powerful hai jab aapko ek state ka multiple values ko manage karna hota hai. Chaliye isko compare karte hain dusre state management solutions ke saath:

---

### 3. **Uses, Pros & Cons of useReducer:**

#### **useReducer**:
1. **Uses**: 
   - Complex state logic ko manage karna, jaise multiple state transitions ya states jo ek dusre se dependent hain.
   - Form management ya complex UI states jahan state changes bahut saari actions se hoti hain.

2. **Pros**:
   - **Predictable State Updates**: Pure functions se state update hota hai, jo ki easier debugging aur testing ko allow karta hai.
   - **Separation of Concerns**: State management ko components se alag rakhta hai, jo code ko modular banata hai.
   - **Performance Optimization**: Large components ko re-render nahi hota agar state changes sirf unke andar nahi hote.

3. **Cons**:
   - **Boilerplate Code**: `useReducer` use karne par actions aur reducers define karne ki zarurat hoti hai, jo code ko thoda verbose bana sakta hai.
   - **Learning Curve**: Beginners ke liye `useReducer` thoda complex ho sakta hai agar unhe Redux ya functional programming ka concept nahi pata.
   - **Limited to Component Scope**: `useReducer` sirf component level par state manage karta hai, jisse global state ke liye alag solution ki zarurat hoti hai.

### 5. **Example of useReducer**:

#### useReducer Example:

```javascript
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

// Step 1: Define the initial state
const initialState = { count: 0 };

// Step 2: Define the reducer function
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

// Step 3: Create the component
function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  return (
    <div>
      Count: {state.count}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Example of useState:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      Count: {count}
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 6. **Output Result**:

1. **For useReducer**:
   - Initially: `Count: 0`
   - After clicking **Increment**: `Count: 1`
   - After clicking **Decrement**: `Count: 0`

2. **For useState**:
   - Initially: `Count: 0`
   - After clicking **Increment**: `Count: 1`
   - After clicking **Decrement**: `Count: 0`

---

### Conclusion:

- **useReducer** is an excellent choice for managing complex state logic and scenarios where multiple state transitions are involved, while still being contained within a component.
- For simpler state needs, **useState** is sufficient, but for more extensive applications requiring global state, other solutions like **Redux**, **Recoil**, or **MobX** might be more suitable.
- Overall, the choice between these solutions depends on the complexity of your application, your team's familiarity with the tools, and your specific state management needs.
