# Prompts : Ecoommerce Project
```
I am building an e-commerce system with two roles: admin and user. Please create a detailed JSON response that includes:
- All admin actions: managing products, stock, categories, orders, and users.
- All user actions: registration, login, cart, wishlist, order placement, and reviews.
- Step-by-step flow for both roles.
- Include relationships between components like users, products, and orders.
Ensure the response is highly detailed and no steps are skipped.
```

### **E-Commerce Platform Dry Run Flow**
Here is the detailed **step-by-step flow** for both **Admin** and **User** roles, ensuring no point is missed.

---

### **1. Admin Flow**

#### **Step 1: Login**
- **Admin action:** Admin logs into the system using:
  - **Username:** `admin_user`

     - Fills in product details like:
       - `Name`, `Category`, `Price`, `Stock Quantity`, `Discount`, `Description`, and `Image URL`.
     - Submits the form, and the product is added to the **Products JSON**.
  2. **Edit Product:**  
     - Selects a product to update details like price, stock, or discount.
     - Backend updates the product in the database and refreshes the JSON.

### **2. User Flow**

#### **Step 1: Registration**

- **Steps:**
  1. Backend updates the user's **Cart JSON** with:
     - `Product ID`, `Name`, `Price`, `Quantity`, and `Total Price`.
  2. Cart total is recalculated and displayed.

#### **Step 5: Add to Wishlist**
- **User action:** Saves a product for later purchase.
- **Steps:**

### **Key Features and Relationships**
This JSON is structured to capture every possible action by both roles. The relationships are as follows:
1. **Admin-Manages**:
   - `Products`, `Categories`, `Stock`, `Orders`, and `Users` roles.
2. **User-Manages**:
   - Their `Cart`, `Wishlist`, `Orders`, `Profile`, and `Reviews`.

This structure ensures that all actions are traceable, data updates are centralized, and the flow is easy to follow for any e-commerce application. Let me know if you'd like further refinements!
