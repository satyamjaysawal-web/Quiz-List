### üî• **Data Retrieval & Querying in SQL**

Data retrieval and querying in SQL is done primarily using the **`SELECT`** statement. It allows users to fetch, filter, sort, group, and aggregate data from one or more tables. Below is a comprehensive guide to SQL querying for data retrieval.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Basic Retrieval**
#### Select All Columns
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```
- Retrieves all columns from the table.
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

#### Select Specific Columns
```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
```
- Fetches only specific columns.
```sql
SELECT name, salary FROM employees;
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Filtering Data**
#### `WHERE` Clause
- Filters rows based on a condition.
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR';
```

#### Logical Operators
- Combine multiple conditions with `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`.
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age > 30 AND department = 'Finance';
```

#### Pattern Matching with `LIKE`
- Searches for patterns in string data.
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE 'A%';  -- Names starting with 'A'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE '%n';  -- Names ending with 'n'
```

#### Range Filter with `BETWEEN`
- Filters rows within a specific range.
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary BETWEEN 60000 AND 80000;
```

#### Match Specific Values with `IN`
- Matches any value in a list.
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department IN ('HR', 'Finance');
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Sorting Data**
#### `ORDER BY`
- Sorts data in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order.
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Limiting Results**
#### `LIMIT`
- Limits the number of rows returned.
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 5;
```

#### Offset Results
- Skips a specified number of rows before returning the results.
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 5 OFFSET 10;  -- Rows 11-15
```

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Aggregate Functions**
- Perform calculations on groups of rows and return a single result.

#### Count Rows
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_employees FROM employees;
```

#### Calculate Total
```sql
SELECT SUM(salary) AS total_salary FROM employees;
```

#### Find Average
```sql
SELECT AVG(salary) AS average_salary FROM employees;
```

#### Find Minimum and Maximum
```sql
SELECT MIN(salary) AS min_salary, MAX(salary) AS max_salary FROM employees;
```

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Grouping Data**
#### `GROUP BY`
- Groups rows based on one or more columns.
```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_employees FROM employees GROUP BY department;
```

#### Filtering Groups with `HAVING`
- Filters aggregated data.
```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department 
HAVING avg_salary > 60000;
```

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Joining Tables**
- Combines rows from multiple tables based on related columns.

#### Inner Join
- Retrieves rows that have matching values in both tables.
```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.name AS department_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

#### Left Join
- Retrieves all rows from the left table, and matching rows from the right table.
```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.name AS department_name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ **Subqueries**
- Query inside another query.

#### Subquery in `WHERE`
```sql
SELECT name, salary 
FROM employees 
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

#### Subquery in `SELECT`
```sql
SELECT name, 
       (SELECT department FROM departments WHERE departments.id = employees.department_id) AS department_name
FROM employees;
```

---

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ **Full-Text Search**
- Search for text patterns in large text columns using a full-text index.
```sql
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX idx_description ON products(description);
SELECT * FROM products WHERE MATCH(description) AGAINST('laptop');
```

---

### üîç **Query Optimization Techniques**
1. **Use Indexes**:
   - Ensure indexed columns are used in `WHERE`, `JOIN`, or `ORDER BY` clauses.
   ```sql
   EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = 'Alice';
   ```

2. **Avoid `SELECT *`**:
   - Select only the required columns.
   ```sql
   SELECT name, salary FROM employees;
   ```

3. **Limit Results**:
   - Use `LIMIT` to fetch only necessary rows.

4. **Analyze Query Performance**:
   - Use `EXPLAIN` to understand how MySQL executes a query.
   ```sql
   EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR';
   ```

5. **Use Joins Instead of Subqueries**:
   - Joins are generally faster and more efficient than subqueries.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ **Advanced Querying**
#### Case Statement
- Add conditional logic to queries.
```sql
SELECT name, 
       CASE 
           WHEN salary > 70000 THEN 'High'
           WHEN salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 70000 THEN 'Medium'
           ELSE 'Low'
       END AS salary_range
FROM employees;
```

#### Window Functions
- Perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row.
```sql
SELECT name, salary, 
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
FROM employees;
```

#### Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Define temporary result sets for use within a query.
```sql
WITH high_earners AS (
    SELECT name, salary FROM employees WHERE salary > 70000
)
SELECT * FROM high_earners;
```

### üî• **Normalization and Database Design**

**Normalization** is a systematic approach in database design to organize data efficiently and minimize redundancy. It involves dividing a database into tables and defining relationships to ensure data consistency and integrity. Proper database design using normalization improves performance and simplifies maintenance.

---

### **Key Objectives of Normalization**
1. **Eliminate Redundancy**: Avoid storing duplicate data.
2. **Ensure Data Integrity**: Maintain consistency across tables.
3. **Optimize Storage**: Save space by avoiding unnecessary data duplication.
4. **Facilitate Maintenance**: Make the database structure more understandable and easier to modify.

---

### **Normalization Forms**
Normalization is divided into several "normal forms" (NF), each with specific requirements.

---

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **First Normal Form (1NF)**

**Requirements**:
- The table should have a **primary key**.
- Each column should contain **atomic values** (indivisible data).
- No repeating groups or arrays.

**Example (Unnormalized Table)**:
| **ID** | **Name**   | **Subjects**         |
|--------|------------|----------------------|
| 1      | Alice      | Math, Physics        |
| 2      | Bob        | Chemistry, Biology   |

**Normalized to 1NF**:
| **ID** | **Name**   | **Subject**  |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| 1      | Alice      | Math         |
| 1      | Alice      | Physics      |
| 2      | Bob        | Chemistry    |
| 2      | Bob        | Biology      |

---

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Second Normal Form (2NF)**

**Requirements**:
- Must meet **1NF** requirements.
- All **non-key attributes** must depend on the **whole primary key** (not part of it).
- Eliminate **partial dependency**.

**Example (1NF)**:
| **StudentID** | **CourseID** | **StudentName** | **CourseName** |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1             | 101          | Alice           | Math           |
| 2             | 102          | Bob             | Physics        |

- `StudentName` depends only on `StudentID`.
- `CourseName` depends only on `CourseID`.

**Normalized to 2NF**:
**Student Table**:
| **StudentID** | **StudentName** |
|---------------|-----------------|
| 1             | Alice           |
| 2             | Bob             |

**Course Table**:
| **CourseID** | **CourseName** |
|--------------|----------------|
| 101          | Math           |
| 102          | Physics        |

**Enrollment Table**:
| **StudentID** | **CourseID** |
|---------------|--------------|
| 1             | 101          |
| 2             | 102          |

---

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Third Normal Form (3NF)**

**Requirements**:
- Must meet **2NF** requirements.
- All **non-key attributes** must depend **only on the primary key**.
- Eliminate **transitive dependency**.

**Example (2NF)**:
| **EmployeeID** | **DepartmentID** | **DepartmentName** |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| 1              | 101               | HR                 |
| 2              | 102               | IT                 |

- `DepartmentName` depends on `DepartmentID`, not directly on `EmployeeID`.

**Normalized to 3NF**:
**Employee Table**:
| **EmployeeID** | **DepartmentID** |
|----------------|-------------------|
| 1              | 101               |
| 2              | 102               |

**Department Table**:
| **DepartmentID** | **DepartmentName** |
|------------------|---------------------|
| 101              | HR                  |
| 102              | IT                  |

---

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**

**Requirements**:
- A stricter version of **3NF**.
- Every determinant (column or set of columns that uniquely identifies another column) must be a **candidate key**.

**Example (3NF)**:
| **CourseID** | **InstructorID** | **InstructorName** |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| 101          | 1                 | Alice              |
| 102          | 1                 | Alice              |

- `InstructorName` depends on `InstructorID` but not on the primary key (`CourseID`).

**Normalized to BCNF**:
**Course Table**:
| **CourseID** | **InstructorID** |
|--------------|-------------------|
| 101          | 1                 |
| 102          | 1                 |

**Instructor Table**:
| **InstructorID** | **InstructorName** |
|------------------|---------------------|
| 1                | Alice              |

---

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Fourth Normal Form (4NF)**

**Requirements**:
- Must meet **BCNF** requirements.
- No **multivalued dependencies**.

**Example (BCNF)**:
| **StudentID** | **Hobby**  | **Skill**  |
|---------------|------------|------------|

| 1             | Cycling    | Python     |
| 1             | Reading    | SQL        |

**Normalized to 4NF**:
**Student-Hobby Table**:
| **StudentID** | **Hobby**  |
|---------------|------------|
| 1             | Reading    |
| 1             | Cycling    |

**Student-Skill Table**:
| **StudentID** | **Skill**  |
|---------------|------------|
| 1             | Python     |
| 1             | SQL        |

### **Steps for Database Design**

1. **Requirement Analysis**:
   - Understand the data requirements of the system.
   - Identify entities (e.g., students, courses) and relationships (e.g., enrollment).

2. **Conceptual Design**:
   - Use an **ER (Entity-Relationship)** diagram to represent the data model.
   - Identify entities, attributes, and relationships.
   - Define cardinality (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many).

   Example:
   - Entity: `Student`
     - Attributes: `StudentID`, `Name`, `Age`

3. **Logical Design**:
   - Convert the ER diagram into a relational schema.
   - Apply normalization to eliminate redundancy and ensure integrity.

4. **Physical Design**:
   - Define storage details such as indexes, constraints, and data types.
   - Optimize the schema for query performance.

5. **Implementation**:
   - Use SQL to create tables, relationships, and constraints.

---

### **Best Practices for Database Design**

1. **Follow Normalization Rules**:
   - Ensure the schema meets at least **3NF** to minimize redundancy.
   - Consider denormalization only for performance-critical scenarios.

2. **Define Primary and Foreign Keys**:
   - Ensure every table has a **primary key**.
   - Use **foreign keys** to enforce relationships.

3. **Use Appropriate Data Types**:
   - Select data types that fit the data being stored (e.g., `VARCHAR(100)` for names, `DATE` for dates).

4. **Add Indexes**:
   - Create indexes on frequently queried columns to improve performance.
   - Avoid indexing low-cardinality columns.

5. **Avoid Over-Normalization**:
   - While normalization reduces redundancy, excessive normalization can lead to complex joins and impact performance.

6. **Plan for Scalability**:
   - Design for growth, considering the potential increase in data volume.

---

### **Example: Normalized Database Design**

#### **ER Diagram Example**
Entities:
- `Student` (Attributes: `StudentID`, `Name`, `Age`)
- `Course` (Attributes: `CourseID`, `CourseName`)
- `Enrollment` (Attributes: `StudentID`, `CourseID`, `EnrollmentDate`)

#### **Relational Schema**
1. **Student Table**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Student (
       StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       Name VARCHAR(100),
       Age INT
   );
   ```

2. **Course Table**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Course (
       CourseID INT PRIMARY KEY,
       CourseName VARCHAR(100)
   );
   ```

3. **Enrollment Table**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Enrollment (
       StudentID INT,
       CourseID INT,
       EnrollmentDate DATE,
       PRIMARY KEY (StudentID, CourseID),
       FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Student(StudentID),
       FOREIGN KEY (CourseID) REFERENCES Course(CourseID)
   );
   ```

---

### **Advantages of Normalization**
1. **Data Integrity**:
   - Ensures consistent and accurate data.

2. **Reduced Redundancy**:
   - Avoids duplication, saving storage space.

3. **Improved Query Performance**:
   - Queries become faster with optimized relationships and indexes.

4. **Flexibility**:
   - Easier to modify and update the schema without affecting data integrity.

---

### **Disadvantages of Normalization**
1. **Complex Joins**:
   - Normalization often leads to many small tables, resulting in complex joins for queries.

2. **Performance Overhead**:
   - Over-normalization can slow down read-heavy queries.

3. **Higher Design Effort**:
   - Initial design requires thorough understanding and planning.

---

### üî• **Summary**

| **Normalization Form** | **Objective**                       | **Key Feature**                                         |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **1NF**                | Eliminate repeating groups          | Atomic columns, unique rows                           |
| **2NF**                | Eliminate partial dependencies      | Full functional dependency                            |

### üî• **Views in MySQL**

A **view** in MySQL is a virtual table based on the result set of a SQL query. It does not store data physically but provides a dynamic, logical representation of data from one or more tables.

---

### **Key Features of Views**
1. **Virtual Table**: Views do not store data themselves; they fetch data dynamically when queried.
2. **Simplifies Complex Queries**: Encapsulates complex SQL queries into reusable objects.
3. **Data Security**: Restricts access to specific columns or rows for certain users.
4. **Up-to-Date**: Reflects the latest data from the base tables.
5. **Read-Only or Updatable**: Views can be read-only or updatable (with certain restrictions).

---

### **Syntax for Creating a View**

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT columns
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

---

### **Examples**

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Simple View
Create a view to show employees from the HR department.
```sql
CREATE VIEW hr_employees AS
SELECT id, name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'HR';
```

Query the view:
```sql
SELECT * FROM hr_employees;
```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ View with Joins
Create a view to display employees along with their department names from a `departments` table.
```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_details AS
SELECT e.id, e.name, e.salary, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

Query the view:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employee_details;
```

---

### **Querying a View**

You can use a view just like a table:
```sql
SELECT * FROM view_name WHERE condition;
```

**Example**:
```sql
SELECT name, salary FROM hr_employees WHERE salary > 60000;
```

---

### **Modifying a View**

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Update View
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT new_columns
FROM table_name
WHERE new_condition;
```

**Example**:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW hr_employees AS
SELECT id, name
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'HR' AND salary > 50000;
```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Add Columns to View
Modify the view to include an additional column:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW hr_employees AS
SELECT id, name, salary, joining_date
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'HR';
```

---

### **Deleting a View**

Use the `DROP VIEW` statement to delete a view:
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Example**:
```sql
DROP VIEW hr_employees;
```

---

### **Updatable vs. Read-Only Views**

#### Updatable Views
- Allows `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations on the view.
- Must adhere to certain rules:
  - View must reference only one table.
  - No aggregate functions, `DISTINCT`, or `GROUP BY` clauses in the view.

**Example**:
```sql
CREATE VIEW simple_view AS
SELECT id, name, salary
FROM employees;

UPDATE simple_view SET salary = 70000 WHERE id = 1;
```

#### Read-Only Views
- Views that involve complex queries (e.g., `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `DISTINCT`) or derived columns are read-only.

**Example**:
```sql
CREATE VIEW summary_view AS
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;

-- This will fail as the view is read-only
UPDATE summary_view SET avg_salary = 75000 WHERE department = 'HR';
```

---

### **Benefits of Using Views**

1. **Data Abstraction**: Hide complexity of base table structures from users.
2. **Reusability**: Encapsulate common queries into reusable views.
3. **Data Security**: Expose only the required data to users, restricting access to sensitive columns or rows.
4. **Ease of Maintenance**: Centralize query logic in views, reducing redundancy.

---

### **Limitations of Views**

1. **Performance Overhead**:
   - Views are re-executed dynamically, which may impact performance for complex queries.
2. **Cannot Include Indexes**:
   - Views do not support indexes directly.
3. **Read-Only Restrictions**:
   - Some views cannot be updated or modified.

---

### **Analyzing Views**

#### View Definition
To see the definition of a view:
```sql
SHOW CREATE VIEW view_name;
```

**Example**:
```sql
SHOW CREATE VIEW hr_employees;
```

#### Check Existing Views
List all views in the database:
```sql
SHOW FULL TABLES WHERE TABLE_TYPE = 'VIEW';
```

---

| **Modify a View**     | `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS SELECT ...;`                        |
| **Delete a View**     | `DROP VIEW view_name;`                                                  |
| **Check Definition**  | `SHOW CREATE VIEW view_name;`                                           |
| **List All Views**    | `SHOW FULL TABLES WHERE TABLE_TYPE = 'VIEW';`                           |

### üî• **MySQL Clustering**

**Clustering in MySQL** refers to using **MySQL Cluster** for high availability and scalability. MySQL Cluster is a distributed database that provides high availability, fault tolerance, and horizontal scalability by replicating data across multiple nodes.

It is designed for applications that require fast response times, high throughput, and 24/7 availability.

---

### **Key Features of MySQL Cluster**
1. **High Availability**: No single point of failure; data is distributed across multiple nodes.
2. **Scalability**: Scales horizontally by adding more nodes.

### **MySQL Cluster Architecture**

MySQL Cluster uses a **shared-nothing architecture** and consists of three main components:

1. **Management Nodes (`ndb_mgmd`)**
   - Control and manage the cluster.
   - Provide configuration data to all nodes.
   - Monitor the cluster and handle recovery.

2. **Data Nodes (`ndbd`)**
   - Store the actual data.
   - Responsible for processing data requests.
   - Use synchronous replication to ensure fault tolerance.

3. **SQL Nodes**
   - Provide the MySQL interface.
   - Execute SQL queries and interact with the application.

**Diagram of MySQL Cluster Architecture**:

```

### **Advantages of MySQL Cluster**

1. **High Availability**:
   - Automatic failover ensures uninterrupted service.
   - Data is replicated across multiple nodes.

2. **Scalability**:
   - Scale horizontally by adding more data nodes or SQL nodes.

3. **Fault Tolerance**:
   - If a node fails, the cluster automatically recovers.

4. **In-Memory Storage**:
   - Delivers ultra-low latency for read and write operations.

5. **Geographic Distribution**:
   - Nodes can be distributed across data centers.

6. **ACID Transactions**:
   - Provides strong consistency guarantees.

### **Disadvantages of MySQL Cluster**

1. **Complex Setup**:
   - Requires more configuration compared to a standalone MySQL database.

2. **Resource-Intensive**:
   - Needs significant memory and CPU resources for optimal performance.

3. **Not Ideal for Heavy Write Workloads**:
   - Write-heavy applications might experience performance bottlenecks.

4. **Limited Support for Joins**:
   - Complex joins across large datasets can impact performance.

### **Installing and Configuring MySQL Cluster**

#### **Step 1: Install MySQL Cluster Components**
Install the required components (`ndb_mgmd`, `ndbd`, and `mysqld`) on the respective nodes:
```bash
sudo apt-get install mysql-cluster-community-server
```

---

#### **Step 2: Configure Management Node**
Create a configuration file (`config.ini`) for the management node:
```ini
[NDBD DEFAULT]
NoOfReplicas=2

[MYSQLD DEFAULT]
[NDB_MGMD]
HostName=192.168.0.1  # IP of management node
DataDir=/var/lib/mysql-cluster

[NDBD]
HostName=192.168.0.2  # IP of data node 1
DataDir=/usr/local/mysql/data

[NDBD]
HostName=192.168.0.3  # IP of data node 2
DataDir=/usr/local/mysql/data

[MYSQLD]
HostName=192.168.0.4  # IP of SQL node
```

---

#### **Step 3: Configure Data Nodes**
On each data node, configure the **`my.cnf`** file:
```ini
[mysqld]
ndbcluster
ndb-connectstring=192.168.0.1  # IP of management node
```

---

#### **Step 4: Start the Cluster**
- Start the management node:
  ```bash
  ndb_mgmd -f /path/to/config.ini
  ```

- Start the data nodes:
  ```bash
  ndbd
  ```

- Start the SQL nodes:
  ```bash
  mysqld --ndbcluster
  ```

---

#### **Step 5: Verify the Cluster**
Use the `ndb_mgm` tool to verify the cluster status:
```bash
ndb_mgm
show
```

---

### **MySQL Cluster Use Cases**

1. **Telecommunications**:
   - Real-time call data storage and billing systems.

2. **Financial Services**:
   - High-speed transaction processing for banking and trading applications.

3. **E-commerce**:
   - Scalable and highly available backends for online stores.

4. **IoT Applications**:
   - Handling large volumes of real-time sensor data.

5. **Gaming**:
   - Real-time scoreboards, player stats, and multiplayer game states.

---

### **Best Practices for MySQL Clustering**

1. **Ensure Sufficient Resources**:
   - Allocate enough memory, CPU, and network bandwidth for nodes.

2. **Use In-Memory Storage**:
   - For ultra-fast performance, use in-memory storage for critical data.

3. **Optimize Configuration**:
   - Tune parameters such as `NoOfReplicas`, `MaxNoOfConcurrentOperations`, and `DataMemory`.

4. **Monitor the Cluster**:
   - Use monitoring tools like **MySQL Enterprise Monitor** or **ndb_mgm**.

5. **Distribute Nodes Across Locations**:
   - For disaster recovery, distribute nodes across multiple data centers.

### üî• **Example Query for MySQL Cluster**

Once the cluster is running, you can use standard MySQL queries via the SQL nodes:
```sql
USE cluster_database;

-- Insert data
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, department, salary) VALUES (1, 'Alice', 'HR', 60000);

-- Retrieve data
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR';

-- Update data
UPDATE employees SET salary = 65000 WHERE id = 1;

-- Delete data
DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 1;
```
