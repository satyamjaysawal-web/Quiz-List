### **Docker Container vs Docker Image**

In Docker, there are two essential concepts: **Docker Images** and **Docker Containers**. These concepts are fundamental to understanding how Docker works and how it helps in application deployment, scalability, and isolation.

Here’s a detailed comparison between **Docker Container** and **Docker Image**:

---

### **1. Docker Image**

A **Docker image** is a **read-only** blueprint that defines the environment, libraries, dependencies, and the application itself. It is the template used to create containers.

#### **Key Characteristics of a Docker Image:**
- **Immutable**: Once an image is built, it cannot be changed. Any changes (like installing new dependencies) would require a new image to be built.
- **Layered**: Docker images are built in layers. Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a layer (e.g., copying files, installing packages). These layers are stacked together to form the final image.
- **Portable**: Docker images can be shared across different environments and platforms. They can be pushed to Docker registries like Docker Hub or private registries for others to pull and use.
- **Contains everything needed to run an application**: This includes the application code, libraries, runtime, system tools, and configurations.

#### **How to Build a Docker Image**:
A Docker image is typically built from a **Dockerfile** (a text file that contains a series of instructions on how to build the image).

**Example of building an image:**
```bash
# Build a Docker image using a Dockerfile in the current directory.
docker build -t my-app .
```
- `-t my-app`: This gives the image a name (`my-app`).
- `.`: Refers to the current directory where the Dockerfile is located.

#### **How to View Docker Images**:
You can list all the Docker images on your machine by using the following command:
```bash
docker images
```
This will show a list of available images, their tags, sizes, and creation dates.

---

### **2. Docker Container**

A **Docker container** is a **running instance** of a Docker image. It is an executable package that includes everything required to run the application—such as the code, libraries, environment variables, and configurations.

#### **Key Characteristics of a Docker Container:**
- **Mutable**: Unlike Docker images, containers are **writeable**. When a container is started from an image, changes can be made during its execution (e.g., data can be written to the file system inside the container).
- **Ephemeral**: By default, containers are temporary. Once a container stops, its changes (unless persisted) will be lost. However, data can be stored persistently using Docker volumes.
- **Isolated**: Containers run in isolated environments, meaning that they can run different versions of libraries or applications without conflicting with each other.
- **Runtime Environment**: A container is the running process of the image, encapsulated in its own isolated environment (network, filesystem, etc.).

#### **How to Run a Docker Container**:
To run a container, you use the `docker run` command. This command creates a container from an image and starts the application.

**Example:**
```bash
# Run a container from a Docker image
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name my-container my-app
```
- `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
- `-p 8080:8080`: Maps port 8080 on your local machine to port 8080 in the container.
- `--name my-container`: Assigns a name to the container.
- `my-app`: The name of the image to create the container from.

#### **How to View Running Containers**:
You can list all the running containers with the command:
```bash
docker ps
```
This will show the running containers, their IDs, names, and other relevant details.

#### **How to Stop and Remove a Docker Container**:
To stop a running container:
```bash
docker stop my-container
```

To remove a stopped container:
```bash
docker rm my-container
```

### **Difference Between Docker Image and Docker Container**

| **Feature**                  | **Docker Image**                                  | **Docker Container**                                  |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**                | A static, read-only template to create containers. | A running instance of a Docker image.                 |
| **Persistence**               | Immutable (does not change).                     | Mutable (can be modified during runtime).             |
| **Storage**                   | Stored in Docker's image registry.                | Stored in Docker's container runtime (temporary storage). |
| **State**                     | Contains no state.                               | Holds the state of the running application.           |
| **Lifecycle**                 | Exists only as a file on disk or registry.       | Exists as a process when running.                     |
| **Function**                  | Used to create containers.                       | Executes the application based on the image.          |
| **Creation**                  | Built from a Dockerfile.                         | Created when running an image.                        |
| **Example Command**           | `docker build -t image-name .`                    | `docker run -d -p 8080:8080 image-name`               |
| **Changes**                   | No changes can be made after the image is created. | Changes can be made to the running container.         |

### **Docker Image and Container Lifecycle**

1. **Creating a Docker Image**:
   - Write a `Dockerfile` that contains all the instructions to set up the environment and install dependencies.
   - Build the Docker image using the `docker build` command.
   - The image is stored in the Docker registry (locally or remotely).

2. **Running a Docker Container**:
   - The image is used to create and run a container using the `docker run` command.
   - Once the container is created, it runs independently with its own environment.
   
3. **Stopping and Removing Containers**:
   - Containers are stopped using the `docker stop` command and can be removed using the `docker rm` command when no longer needed.

4. **Pushing Images to Docker Registry**:
   - Once you have built an image, you can push it to a Docker registry (such as Docker Hub) so others can pull and use it.
   ```bash
   docker push my-app
   ```

---

### **Conclusion**

- A **Docker image** is a blueprint or template from which containers are created. It is static, portable, and reusable across environments.
- A **Docker container** is the running instance of an image and is mutable, running with its own isolated filesystem and environment.

In a typical development and deployment workflow, you create an image (from a Dockerfile), run a container (from the image), and manage containers for scaling and distributing applications across different environments.

### **Dockerizing Spring Boot Microservices**

Docker is a platform that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into a standardized unit called a **container**. For a **Spring Boot microservices architecture** (like the Netflix-style system described earlier), Docker can help you deploy, scale, and manage these microservices easily.

Here’s a guide on how to Dockerize a **Spring Boot microservices application** with examples.

### **Steps to Dockerize Spring Boot Microservices**

---

### **1. Dockerizing a Spring Boot Application**

#### **A. Create a Dockerfile**

A `Dockerfile` is used to define how your application will be built into a container. Here's a basic Dockerfile for a **Spring Boot application**.

Create a `Dockerfile` in the root of your Spring Boot application project.

```dockerfile
# Step 1: Use the official Java base image
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim as build

# Step 2: Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy the JAR file from the host into the container
COPY target/*.jar app.jar

# Step 4: Expose the port the application will run on
EXPOSE 8080

# Step 5: Run the Spring Boot application
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app/app.jar"]
```

#### **Explanation:**
- **FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim**: This tells Docker to use an official Java image as the base for the container. We’re using OpenJDK 17 in this case.
- **WORKDIR /app**: This sets the working directory inside the container where all the commands will be run.
- **COPY target/*.jar app.jar**: This copies the compiled JAR file from the `target` folder on your local machine into the Docker image.
- **EXPOSE 8080**: This tells Docker to expose port 8080 for your Spring Boot application to communicate externally.
- **ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app/app.jar"]**: This runs the Spring Boot application inside the container using the `java -jar` command.

---

#### **B. Build the Docker Image**

Once the `Dockerfile` is created, you need to build the Docker image.

1. **Package your Spring Boot application** by running the following Maven or Gradle command:
    - **Maven**:
      ```bash
      mvn clean install
      ```
    - **Gradle**:
      ```bash
      ./gradlew build
      ```

2. **Build the Docker image**:
    Navigate to the folder where your `Dockerfile` is located and run the following Docker command to build the image:
    ```bash
    docker build -t springboot-app .
    ```

3. **Verify the Docker image**:
    After building, verify that the image was created:
    ```bash
    docker images
    ```

---

#### **C. Run the Docker Container**

Now, you can run your Spring Boot application inside a Docker container.

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 springboot-app
```

- This maps port 8080 on your local machine to port 8080 inside the container, where the Spring Boot application is running.

---

### **2. Dockerizing Multiple Microservices**

If you have multiple microservices (e.g., **User Service**, **Payment Service**, **Recommendation Service**), you need to create separate Docker images for each service.

#### **A. Example Dockerfile for Multiple Microservices**

Let’s assume you have three microservices: **user-service**, **payment-service**, and **recommendation-service**. Each of these services would have its own `Dockerfile`.

1. **user-service/Dockerfile**:
    ```dockerfile
    FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY target/user-service.jar user-service.jar
    EXPOSE 8081
    ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "user-service.jar"]
    ```

2. **payment-service/Dockerfile**:
    ```dockerfile
    FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY target/payment-service.jar payment-service.jar
    EXPOSE 8082
    ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "payment-service.jar"]
    ```

3. **recommendation-service/Dockerfile**:
    ```dockerfile
    FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY target/recommendation-service.jar recommendation-service.jar
    EXPOSE 8083
    ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "recommendation-service.jar"]
    ```

---

#### **B. Build the Docker Images for Multiple Services**

To build and run multiple microservices, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the service directory** (for each service) and run the Docker build command:
   ```bash
   cd user-service
   docker build -t user-service .
   ```

   Repeat this for **payment-service** and **recommendation-service**.

---

#### **C. Docker Compose for Multiple Microservices**

Using **Docker Compose**, you can define and run multi-container Docker applications. Docker Compose allows you to define all your services in a single file (`docker-compose.yml`) and run them together.

**docker-compose.yml:**

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  user-service:
    image: user-service
    build:
      context: ./user-service
    ports:
      - "8081:8081"
    depends_on:
      - eureka-server

  payment-service:
    image: payment-service
    build:
      context: ./payment-service
    ports:
      - "8082:8082"
    depends_on:
      - eureka-server

  recommendation-service:
    image: recommendation-service
    build:
      context: ./recommendation-service
    ports:
      - "8083:8083"
    depends_on:
      - eureka-server

  eureka-server:
    image: eureka-server
    build:
      context: ./eureka-server
    ports:
      - "8761:8761"
```

This `docker-compose.yml` file:

- Defines four services: **user-service**, **payment-service**, **recommendation-service**, and **eureka-server**.
- Specifies the port mapping for each service.
- Defines dependencies (`depends_on`) so the services start in the right order.

---

### **3. Running the Services with Docker Compose**

To run all your services together, follow these steps:

1. **Make sure Docker Compose is installed**:
   If Docker Compose is not installed, follow the [official instructions to install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

2. **Run Docker Compose**:
   In the directory where your `docker-compose.yml` is located, run the following command:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   - `--build`: This rebuilds the images if there are any changes in the Dockerfiles.
   
3. **Verify that services are running**:
   After running the above command, Docker will start all your microservices as containers. You can check the logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs
   ```

4. **Access the services**:
   Now, your services should be running, and you can access them:
   - **User Service**: `http://localhost:8081`
   - **Payment Service**: `http://localhost:8082`
   - **Recommendation Service**: `http://localhost:8083`
   - **Eureka Server** (Service Discovery): `http://localhost:8761`

---

### **4. Scaling the Microservices with Docker Compose**

You can scale individual services (e.g., run multiple instances of **user-service**) by specifying the `scale` option in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

For example, to run two instances of **user-service**:
```yaml
user-service:
  image: user-service
  build:
    context: ./user-service
  ports:
    - "8081:8081"
  deploy:
    replicas: 2
```

After this, you can run `docker-compose up --scale user-service=2` to start two instances of **user-service**.

---

### **5. Dockerizing Other Services (Zuul, Hystrix, etc.)**

You can follow the same process to Dockerize other services like **Zuul API Gateway**, **Eureka Server**, **Hystrix**, and more. Just add their Dockerfiles and include them in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

---

### **Conclusion**

Docker helps you easily containerize and deploy **Spring Boot microservices**. By using **Docker Compose**, you can manage and scale multiple microservices efficiently. This approach provides consistency across development, staging, and production environments, making it easier to deploy microservices-based applications in a reliable and scalable way.

### **Docker Image and Container Lifecycle**

1. **Creating a Docker Image**:
   - Write a `Dockerfile` that contains all the instructions to set up the environment and install dependencies.
   - Build the Docker image using the `docker build` command.
   - The image is stored in the Docker registry (locally or remotely).

2. **Running a Docker Container**:
   - The image is used to create and run a container using the `docker run` command.
   - Once the container is created, it runs independently with its own environment.
   
3. **Stopping and Removing Containers**:
   - Containers are stopped using the `docker stop` command and can be removed using the `docker rm` command when no longer needed.

4. **Pushing Images to Docker Registry**:
   - Once you have built an image, you can push it to a Docker registry (such as Docker Hub) so others can pull and use it.
   ```bash
   docker push my-app
   ```

- A **Docker image** is a blueprint or template from which containers are created. It is static, portable, and reusable across environments.
- A **Docker container** is the running instance of an image and is mutable, running with its own isolated filesystem and environment.

In a typical development and deployment workflow, you create an image (from a Dockerfile), run a container (from the image), and manage containers for scaling and distributing applications across different environments.

To deploy a complete **Spring Boot microservices architecture** (similar to the Netflix-style system) on **Kubernetes**, you’ll need to containerize all your microservices (such as **User Service**, **Payment Service**, **Recommendation Service**, **Eureka Server**, **Zuul API Gateway**, **Hystrix**, and any other services) and then define Kubernetes configurations to deploy and manage these services.

Below, I will guide you through the **complete Kubernetes setup** with **all services**.

---

### **Step-by-Step Kubernetes Deployment for All Services**

---

### **1. Prerequisites**
Before starting, make sure the following tools are installed and set up:

- **Docker** (for containerizing applications)
- **Kubernetes** (minikube or a cloud provider like AWS EKS, GKE, or AKS)
- **kubectl** (for interacting with Kubernetes)
- A **Container Registry** (Docker Hub, AWS ECR, etc.) to store the Docker images.

---

### **2. Dockerizing the Microservices**

You need to containerize each microservice. Below is a **Dockerfile** template for the **User Service** and an example for other services.

#### **Dockerfile for Each Microservice**
Each service (like **User Service**, **Payment Service**, **Recommendation Service**) will have a similar `Dockerfile`.

For **User Service** (`user-service/Dockerfile`):

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY target/user-service.jar user-service.jar
EXPOSE 8081
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "user-service.jar"]
```

This applies to all other microservices; just change the name of the jar file in the Dockerfile for each service.

#### **Build and Push Docker Images**
- Build Docker images for all services and push them to a container registry (like Docker Hub).

For **User Service**:

```bash
docker build -t username/user-service:latest .
docker push username/user-service:latest
```

Repeat the process for other services like **Payment Service**, **Recommendation Service**, **Zuul**, **Eureka**, and so on.

---

### **3. Kubernetes Configuration for All Services**

Next, create Kubernetes YAML files to define Deployments, Services, and Ingress configurations.

#### **A. User Service Deployment (`user-service-deployment.yaml`)**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: user-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: user-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: user-service
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: user-service
        image: username/user-service:latest  # Use your Docker image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8081
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: user-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: user-service
  ports:
    - port: 8081
      targetPort: 8081
  type: ClusterIP
```

#### **B. Payment Service Deployment (`payment-service-deployment.yaml`)**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: payment-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: payment-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: payment-service
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: payment-service
        image: username/payment-service:latest  # Use your Docker image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8082
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: payment-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: payment-service
  ports:
    - port: 8082
      targetPort: 8082
  type: ClusterIP
```

#### **C. Recommendation Service Deployment (`recommendation-service-deployment.yaml`)**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: recommendation-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: recommendation-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: recommendation-service
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: recommendation-service
        image: username/recommendation-service:latest  # Use your Docker image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8083
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: recommendation-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: recommendation-service
  ports:
    - port: 8083
      targetPort: 8083
  type: ClusterIP
```

#### **D. Eureka Server Deployment (`eureka-server-deployment.yaml`)**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: eureka-server
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: eureka-server

### **4. Kubernetes Ingress Configuration**

To expose the services to external traffic, you can use an **Ingress** controller. If using **Zuul** as an API Gateway, you can configure **Ingress** like so:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: api-gateway-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: api.gateway.local  # Replace with your domain or external IP
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /user
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: user-service
            port:
              number: 8081
      - path: /payment
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: payment-service
            port:
              number: 8082
      - path: /recommendation
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: recommendation-service
            port:
              number: 8083
      - path: /hystrix
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: hystrix-dashboard
            port:
              number: 8084
```

---

### **5. Deploying the Services to Kubernetes**

Now, apply all Kubernetes configurations.

1. **Apply Kubernetes Configurations**:

For each YAML file (e.g., `user-service-deployment.yaml`, `payment-service-deployment.yaml`, etc.), run the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f user-service-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f payment-service-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f recommendation-service-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f eureka-server-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f zuul-gateway-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f hystrix-dashboard-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f api-gateway-ingress.yaml  # If using Ingress
```

2. **Check Deployments and Services**:

```bash
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services
```

3. **Accessing the Application**:

- **If using Ingress**: Access the services using the external domain (e.g., `api.gateway.local`).
- **If using NodePort or LoadBalancer**: Access the services using the assigned IP or port.

---

### **6. Scaling the Microservices**

To scale any service, for example, to scale **user-service** to 5

 replicas:

```bash
kubectl scale deployment user-service --replicas=5
```

---

### **7. Conclusion**

Now you have a fully configured Spring Boot microservices architecture with **User Service**, **Payment Service**, **Recommendation Service**, **Zuul API Gateway**, **Hystrix Dashboard**, and **Eureka Server**, deployed on Kubernetes.

Using Kubernetes for deployment, scaling, and management of your microservices provides high availability, resiliency, and a cloud-native architecture that can scale dynamically.
